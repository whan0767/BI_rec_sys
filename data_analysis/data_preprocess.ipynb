Minecraft Style I guess...\"However, after playing it for almost 2 hours, I've realised that this game...Is nothing like Minecraft in terms on gaming content/adventure.If you've ever wished to get DayZ and want to get a first-hand experience of it, this game will be a great start!I do recommend that you guys play with a friend, and not Single Player (Just yet...)My feeling about this game is that it will become a game that requires intense TeamWork, Co-ordination and communication (Recommend: Use Voice Chat in Steam for the meantime).So for those who feel this game isn't worth playing because it looks boring, please think twice...I would have regretted my choice if I didn't choose to play this game for a while.\n",

      "Once all the twelvies aren't playing, and you're up against people who know what they're doing, it's a great game. When all slots are filled it's highly balanced. It's controls are responsive and nothing beats sniping a shark while hanging upside down in the corner with a harpoon.The only problem is the AI. In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends. And it isn't completely worth paying full price for it.\n",
      "Where do I begin...I trusted you Bethesda. From all the time I spent with FO3... I never could have imagined this garbage is what you'd spew up from the depths of whatever 'creative' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you'd turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It's not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more 'console-friendly' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe. It's like they say - \"IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!\" Do yourself a favour and buy Fallout: New Vegas, instead of this $80 squirming feeling of regret and hopelessness.\n",
      "3 years I've played this game and although that doesn't seem as much as a lot of people due to the fact that this game is one of the oldest on Steam people questioned me why I played it and some even made fun of me for it. The TF2 community might be at the lowest yet with the new Tough Break update but still even if the biggest people in TF2 such as Jerma985 and Star_ are sick of it I am not it just shows how much this game has dragged me back to it even if I rejected to,eventually I would return and play because I know I want to most my friends that I played TF2 with I barely even see play it but I don't care this game is one of the most special games I've ever played and it was one of the very first games that I've actually stuck around on others I got bored of after getting sick and tired of their repetitive style but still for some reason this game is the only one where I won't stop even if I want to.I'll get to the point of it now I absolutely LOVE and I mean LOVE this game no matter what people tell me about how it isn't as competetive as CS:GO or it is stupid because of how they're always hats on people's heads this game is different from your normal FPS games you actually have to work as a team well to win the game not just run around and shoot people its classes are all balanced and don't handle like COD,Battlefield or CS:GO which shows how different it is so why not give it a try if I and many can enjoy it shows no reason why you can't go download TF2 now and I mean NOW Mr.\n",
      "So I play ARK on and off with my friends because it’s just fun to join servers and scurry to make a settlement or base and bicker about who own what dinosaurs. Then I get told by one of more hardcore ARK friends that they added payed DLC. This shows me that the developers still care for this game and its players, and they wanted to enhance their player experience with new ones. I feel sorry for the games development team for having to deal with all these entitled precious little children that believe that they are owed free content just for playing for an extended amount of time. Keep up the good work ARK devs. Until you reach DayZ levels of lazy then you have done nothing wrong by me.\n",
      "This game is awesome. Its like minecraft and dayz combined, with the voxly box world this game utilizes, its like a more mature version of minecraft, without the high stakes and risk of losing your gear, unlike dayZ, 7days to die is more forgiving. Playing this game by yourself is good to see what you can build in the time but its even more fun to play with friends. Don't mistake this as minecraft though, i Find it brings a more personal touch to a survival game.\n",
      "This is an awesome game. May overtake team fortress 2. This game is an awesome shooter. You play as different classes and like blacklight retribution you need to spend time farming coins to unlock characters for ever or you can wait for monthly trial rotations of the characters. Is great to play with friends and solo.\n",

      "What I think personally?This is a really great game, with some smart ideas and good gameplay.This game is better playing with friends but the multiplayer setup is way to confusing to understand (at least for me).even though its in Early Access people still tend to complain about the most stupidest things, like bugs/glitches and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and how dinosaurs can kill you so easily.THEIR ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS WHAT DID YOU EXPECT, you can't just go running up to one with a gun, shot it and expect it to die insistently.Aspects:-Its a game where you have to be stealthy and really have to listen (so its best to play with a good headset) and YOU don't want to make too much noise (such as running) near a Dino, because it will hear you. because of   this it really adds to the atmosphere and the environment, and what you would most probably to in a situation like that.-The Dinosaurs are pretty good, since the game is early access there are only a couple of Dino species in the game, Each Dino has a weak point (being the heart and ♥♥♥♥) attacking there does more damage then attacking like the side or neck.they can be a pain to kill but once you do. you get that feeling of accomplishment.-The weapons are alright, you'll be lucky to find a big crate containing a weapon or clothes?But mostly you get ammo for the gun you haven't found, but the weapons do some good damage, just make sure you aim at the right areas of the dinosaurs to do MORE damage.-The map, Oh Boy, THE MAP IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING, its huge it has amazing looks and landmarks ^-^The only downside to the map is climbing up slopes, they can be really steep and if you climb up a mountain, half way it will become too steep and you can't climb any further. Plus you can take fall damage from sliding down slops so watch out- Loot Crates do spawn all around the map, and there's certain areas where good loot spawns.Loot mostly contains:WeaponsClothesAmmoHealthFinal:As i said the game is still in early access so not everything is in the game, but it still is a great game to playJust don't ♥♥♥♥ off a T-Rex, okay? Final-Final:So is this  a good game to buy and play: YESIt is worth the $20 you stole\n",
      "+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above.\n",

      "Alright so this game is, amazing. Alot of people say it copied ARK but you're wrong. Anyways to a review -The game is awesome, so many things to do great with friends, everything you really need. There is a downside though that really hurts the community in AustraliaNo AUS servers. They may be coming soon but at the moment, I go on it regularly just to see if its had an update for AUS servers. I would still recommend picking it up if its on sale (Atleast 25%) and play with friends on a local hosted server.I give it a thumbs up, but if you're in Australia, don't bother unless you are a singeplayer person, stand high ping or if its atleast 50% off.~Hope this helped\n",
      "This game.. Its fricken Amazing. If you want to be the badass, you play this game. Wild Western Themed with Intense gameplay. Your enemies arn't Flies, They're people, you can't just squash them, They go down with a fight. You may think this game is 2ez4u, but trust me, try it, and you will think differently. This game is the one that you come to when there is nothing to play, the MEGA DOWNFALL is that, its community is dead, there is only about 12 people on. I sat on that game, for 20 minutes on computer, and there was not a single player. On PS4 its alive with a community. We just need more players and you will realise that this game is fun, and not some stoopid game that no one plays. We need just 1 thing to push it up to the surface, and reach 100players at the least, so we can show people this game is awesome!                                                 So lets notify our friends, to tell their friends to tell their friends, to get this game..\n",

I had to learn from a youtuber (Kage848)Still alot of room for improvementOverall a great game, but I would wait for a sale (Atleast 25% off) to get it.Hope this helps decide if you want this or not!\n",
      "This game is amazing! Its nothing like the ' Call Of Duty ' because its more realistic. Great to play with friends. You may think this game is a little bit to easy, because your a *COD player. But no this is 10x harder then expected. Shooting games don't get as realistic as this.All the *CS games have all been good, but this one is more intresting because of the things you can get. 1 Downside of this game is that camos/skins cost alot of money.I really reccommend this game, so if you see it on sale, fricken buy it!! :3* COD - Call Of Duty* CS - Counterstrike\n",

      "This is a great game.There are a variety of playable characers and they all have their strengths and weaknesses making the gameplay balanced. There are also updates very often that include new things and fix bugs. This game is also free. The only things that you miss out on by not paying are rarer cosmetic items and weapons with kill counters. You can still get everything else. If you are free to play and have generous friends, it is possible to get these things anyway.You should definitely get this.\n",
      "One of the worst PC ports of all time, a truly terrible game. The game is so bad that just having friends come online on Uplay will crash the entire game. This bug has been around since 2012 and still not fixed. If you live in certain regions of the world the online multiplayer is straight up unplayable with terrible host migration. It would of been better off if this game was never made, that is how had it is. Disgusting.\n",
      "A great game however the amount of maps and weapons are quite low compared to L4D2. The graphics and evironment are really well made as well as the sound which coresponse to the gun shots. Be it playing with friends or alone with bots brings never ending thrills. 9/10 Must have if you are a fan of zombie games.\n",
      "It's a great game, but its dead; the only ones who play are high ranked people, If you want to play you better have a group of +8 friends since that way you can make an Inhouse tournament or something, otherwise just buy it for the ♥♥♥♥ of buying GG games, since they're great.Great anime graphics though, Liked those.\n",
      "Great experience. Best part is the player vs player interactions. They really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter (looking at you Nether) But is still a pvp game.The player interactions were good fun (when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running away.)But the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveable.Currently I have one where every 5 minutes I get 1-5 fps and can barely move. Buildings get low texture quality and when inside one I cannot see the walls nor floor.Once they fix the bugs- truly a worthwhile experience.\n",
      "Payday 2 is one of those games where you can muck around as much as you want or play as seriously as you want its all to personal preference. Payday is a first-person bank robbing ,meth cooking, painting stealing simulator and its extremely adictive.  With many different hiest to choose from, bank robbing to cocaine dealing you can aproach each mission in any way you like from equiping the heaviest armor and the strongest gun and going loud to rob a bank to going slow and steady in stealth which does come with a experience bonus. The game is very costumisable from choosing your armor, gun, mask all the way down to your melee. But out of the the costumising you will ever do is your mask whcich defines who you are with over 100 mask to choose from and over 100 different colours and patterns no one ever has the same mask.But all up its a very enjoyable game stealth, loud, with or without friends it dosen't matter the circumstances its a great game for those who enjoy co-op strategic shooter i recomend it to all for only 30 dollars its a great pick up. Yes i know i only have 6 hours on the game when i wrote this review but when the game first came out i played the hell out of it in XBOX 360\n",

If you have heard it's good that's because it is, If you've heard its bad it is only lacking improvement in those area's, this is an Early Access Game = not finished! If you find something the needs work TELL THE TEAM!!!! They are more than happy to include everyone's ideas.

      "Dayz, what a broken game.It is only fun if you are playing with friends that can take the p*ss out of it, but if you don't have extra money to buy friends, you may want to aviod this.Dayz is poorly optimised, has texture pop in, zombies having the amazing ability to hit you from 100ft away and walk through walls (one of them must be god) and picking the right moment for the game to crash on you.The devs put the servers under maintenance but do f*** all to fix the game.

PC graphics are ♥♥♥♥.Not helped by a complete lack of story explanation, completely broken melee and a frustrating cover system. Character models are pretty lousy as well.I REPEAT: SAVE YOUR MONEY.

Still, not that great. But there are cool features about it, and im pretty sure you love it. 5.5/10. But ill still recommended it to you, cause you'll probs have a \"blast\" with this game.\n",

      "Seeing such a great world full of potential in this game. Everything about the game play is great so far. U get to craft, u get to build stuff, and u get to raid and such. But currently this game is ruined by hackers and bad community management. Dun get me wrong, i'm in singapore and almost all the server i've played in has hacker, all the asia server has hacker. all the western server too lag to play. Official server, the name shd make ppl scared to use hack or ♥♥♥♥, but no. there are tons of hackers, ruining the game, u go out, gather resource and get some good gear and suddenly out of nowhere a guy with speed hack flash right infront of u, jerking left,right up and down, and seemingly just smack u to death with a rock, and not once but 4 times. so i said fine, i'll go to other part of the world, bam, aimbots and wall hack shooting from inside a rad town wall. Go to community server? no, admins hacking, admins not bothering about hackers cause they are friend and ♥♥♥♥♥. so unless garry and his team solve this problem, this game is a no go for asian gamers.

      "It's an old game indeed it is, but a great one, a gem at that! It's a steam must have and it was a revolution to the sandbox genre. GMOD is a versatile sandbox that you can tweak the very physics of objects and change them however! I like creating slingshots, hovercars, cars you can't drive because they're way to fast... and hey! You can even put faces on melons! This game can get a little buggy, but all bugs here are halarious! and if you have friends to play with, your in for one hell of a treat!\n",
      "I like pressed play right... and my mum told me i had to put the washing out and i was like....... so i started playing the game and it was like super crayz doriotos... but i only said that cause my friend was getting doritos.... but i havent played the game yet because like its downloading.... so uh yea.\n",
      "Where to start. Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your \"double jump\", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it.\n",
      "Great game, fun to play with friends. Easy and hard levels which makes the gameplay great\n",
      "- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - ( Note, When I play this more (which I will), this review will change.I understand this is early access and has been for quite some time, I also understand bugs/glitches are always going to be there.I've been there the whole way through the greenlight, and I was so excited I could actually play it via steam.I'm deeply inlove with harvest moon, always have been, always will be, this is based off harvest moon, therefor i'm expecting it to be something quite like it.Overall, it has great potential, and when/if it comes out for 3DS/WiiU/Psvita, I'll also be grabbing it on thus consoles i have. I know a lot of work has gone into this game, and a lot more hours will be spent making it the greatest it can be.Pro's- Closest thing to Harvest Moon itself.- Love the details/graphics- Calming Tunes ( May get annoying after awhile )- Easy to waste a year of your life away- Early Access, ( room for improvement )- Somewhat playable- Playable via Steam- Fast and easy start up- many, many more, and I'm sure i'll have more to add when I've played more hours.Cons; Annoying Features/bugs/Glitches I noticed. (JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MORE CONS THAN PRO'S, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A BAD GAME)- Spelling Mistakes, such as, On the sign at the farm, 'ax'. \"they're reactions are similar\", The mayor says 'they's instead of they'd \"- overused words( Dear,Gotcha,Getcha ) makes it seem unprofessional when it's there twice a sentence,- not too detailed about the actual things you need to know- walking through doors sideways and not where the door is.( On the mayors tour )- mayor disappears in the General Shop when first meeting- mistaken he/she at the farm when clearly accepted was a she.. and then says she in the next sentence.- \"they're reactions are similar\"- random 0 when mayor talks about the animal attacks at the start- few music tunes from harvest moon(friends of mineral town+TreeOfTranquility). - First person to visit the farm repeats before roselyn/jessica shows back up- Massive random line of b when jessica shows the above view of town- sleep and save is glitched, Can't save, - can't sleep ( option comes up, is accepted and then nothing happens )- start is an hour long-  No sound effects ( tools, people, walking etc )- Farm Layout Is basically EXACTLY like Harvest moon ( No Originality )- Turnip Seeds glitching and becoming infinite at the start- Controls are bugged and seem to not work ( Interact Button, even when changed. Also Escape for back comes up with exit option, everytime. )\n",
      "As far as card games go, everyone knows they aren't as good as getting together with a few friends and dueling like the good old days, I've struggled to find a decent game that covers everything and Is absolutely fun to play, I must admit, getting the hang of It and learning which Is good and which isn't, does take some time, then again so does learning to ride a bike.This takes the top of the list for Pc card games, Also FTP, so It's definitely worth a look.:)\n",
      "- RECENT REVIEW -New engine, completely rebuilt, lots of updates, It's a pretty decent game again, although, having a beast computer is the only way to see the new engine at its best, It's too overwhelming on my computer, and i'm having trouble playing it with all my settings either off or extremely low.Its got lots of new additions, such as a completely new map, which is absolutely massive, and if you die without a sleeping bag placed, chances are you aren't going to find your spot again anytime soon if ever, horses, they're quite cool, and the deer, the animals are just completely awesome, except for the wolves, they could be downgraded, they run way too fast and glitch all over the place.all different types of building, wood, stone, sheet metal, reinforced, locks, cupboards, There's so many new features and additions, it's all had a makeover and is pretty.. hahaI guess it's a decent game again, depending on the server you play on, I won't be playing it as much as i used to, but it's a nice treat every now and then :)- EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -I stopped playing a fair bit after zombies were removed and replaced with mutant bears and wolves, It just wasn't as much fun, I enjoyed finding an amazing server with a decent community, running around the map on resource runs and seeing who could headshot a zombie first, Zombies really were the highlight of this game for me, after that was removed, everything went bad, there were no decent servers, there were hackers, less updates, found myself and a friend just throwing flares down a hill and watching it roll, for about 3 hours, and that was all we did. Thus, Rust had nothing more to offer for me and I completely stopped playing it.- EARLY EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -Rust well.. It's different.It may be in Alpha but it's already such a great game, I'm excited and dreading new updates, I love the way it is at the moment, not knowing if the upcoming developments will ruin what i think or make it even better, going to have to wait and find out, I spend most of my time playing this game, Surely enough playing on a populated server isn't a good idea, it'll ruin your experience all together, the key is to find a decent server with only about 20-40 people online, i'd say start off with a pve until you get the hang of things. Also playing on Official servers aren't exactly the best idea.Wolves and bears have a fair amount of health compared to the zombies, bears and wolves you have to avoid until you have a bow or a gun, zombies you can take on with a pickaxe etc. This is a great game and definitely worth the money, considering it's in Alpha, it's damn well good.I thought it'd be one of those games that look great but turn out pretty bad, Looks great, is great.The only downer for me is the fact it over heats my laptop, and that's when I play with Render Quality 0, and run it on the fastest option. The graphics are great.. but I can't really play with them. I have a decent gaming laptop.. but still It overheats so I have to take breaks and I don't like that.All in all, Great game, definitely worth a look at :)I'm sure more people would buy it if there was a demo, then again it's in alpha and only $20, Still worth a look :)I surely don't regret this game and I won't anytime soon =D\n",
      "I higher recommend this game to all of my friends and anyone else that enjoy's a teamworking or solo survival game, This by far one of the most outstanding games of 2016 and many more years to come, if you dont have Rust i suggest you buy it for only $20.-ItsJustEthan\n",
      "played game for solid like 100 hours. spent 20 of them trying to make the game work. then spent the next 10 finding friends. built house with friends . died to 7 people that blew our house up. gave up at game for a while downloaded and tried to play again spent another 20 hours trying to make it work and now have given up 10/10 would spend more time trying to make game work than actually playing game\n",
      "Saddly one of the worst games i have played and me being me i have also played Roblox and what dose that tell you? anyway this game is very slow at the start reaches a medium and just DROPS after you complete everything and then what? hackers everywhere you go on 1 server hacker here another there they are everywhere. I dont just not recommend this game i dont even know why the **** it was even eccepted through the steam greenlight what why 1 vote of a guy that has 9 accounts and works for rockstar games? i have said all i will say if you want 100 more reasons on why this game sucks **** add me as a friend and type to me \"i want 100 reasons on to why this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game sucks* thank you Also for a cheaper and better version of this game just use the GTAVOnline gamemode for garrys mod its pretty good and $80 less.\n",
      "I love this game its very creative and fun, but in the  new 3.0 update its missing one thing that the 2.2 has... HOST! it needs a host button! because all the local servers are either pvp/laggy/lost of people and me and my friend dont like that so, games good keep updating but add a host button! it would help alot! thanks                                                                                                                                        -CBR1000RR\n",
      "Dayz running simulator 2014,My favourite game out now!besides whats more fun than handcuffing your friends and making thm chug bleach\n",
      "Really great game, even as of now. Played it with 3 others on a computer that was streamed to a PC using Xbox controllers, very fluid and fun game. The bot AI is quite good as well, would recommend picking up if you've got a spare $10 and a couple friends laying around somewhere.\n",
      "anybody have no friends who have this gamewe can be friends and play together my steam is Bob\n",
      "The journey through the game was very fun (and very difficult), and made me laugh while also making me want to stab myself in the eye with a screwdriver.The ending was amazing, my friend and I were so happy we made it to the end, and also super relieved we didn't have to torture ourselves any longer. 10/10 - Make sure no charp objects are near when playing.\n",
      "Unlike its new sequel; Dark Souls 3, DS2 has done something that completely astounds players to this very day, something that made the game what it was. Around the launch of DS3 i would spend hours watching PvP, reviews and lore videos while i was saving for the game. One faithful day i stumbled across a review that changed my entire perspective on it, something so terrible i could not bare to spend a single dollar on that embarrasment that is DS3. The review simply stated some broken and missing mechanics that of which are alive and well in DS2. What are these key mechanics you may ask? To put it simply in a complete and utter overlook on fromsofts behalf, they managed to leave out the single thing that made DS2 so superior, so excellent. That mechanic my friend is Common Fruit.9/10 Hopefully FromSoft redeems themselves by readding Common Fruit in their new DLC and then maybe i will purchase DS3.\n",
      "This game is amazingly infuriating. Buy it and gift it to your friends, just don't play it yourself.If it wasn't extended it would be even better, one playthrough was enough\n",
      "i don't know what to say about this game... this game might look cheap but don't let the price fool you this game is really enjoyble the game play was really easy just doing quest killing zombie looting bad guys and stuff you name it. idk the storyline is not really good but hey you have a free-roaming world you can go anywhere you want i would recommend this game to my friend  10/10\n",
      "this is really good game to play with your friend you won't be disapointed if you buy this it has almost everthing we want for action side scroll  game the skill system co-op system overall this game is AWESOME  so buy it and let's go kick some alien butt :3\n",
      "i have no friends to play with so this game is not fun but sure play it if you have friends EUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n",
      "Awesome game, the feature of having a king taxing other players is amazing. Meeting up with friends and building bases is good as, and it feels really satisfying to get new gear. The only bad thing is it crashes like 3 times an hour, but it is alpha so ye.\n",
      "this game is really fun, although i should recommend this to VERY good players. it is super challenging to start off cause you will  run in to bandits, dogs, bears and hunger, very often when you start. my advice is to play with friends to make gameplay more easier and fun. but if you have no friends, i will advise you to watch some youtube videos before you start.\n",
      "Very Fun! Is Best Played when playing with friends! I loved playing as engineer but I also like other classes as well!ProsFREE!  Lots of Game Modes! Lots of Classes! Helpful Turtorials! Single player and Multiplayer! Lots of Different Types of Weapons! Lots of Maps!Cons To do well you need to buy a few weapons! Can be boring if playing without a friend! is vilont and bloody (Is a Pro if you like that kind of struff)! If you want good weapons without paying it can require a lot of hours!\n",
      "played it with a friend and most kills were accidentally killing each other10/10\n",
      "This is a game that is just Fantastic to play with your friends or with others, the workshop is also pretty top and just creating random stuff is a blast!\n",
      "This game is surprisingly good, I recommend it if youre looking for a new coop game to play with friends or just a nice open world game mixed with parkour. Story (6/10):  While nothing special it does have its set of memorable characters. The main cast is pretty average and forgettable but the characters in the side quests are hilariously whacky and memorable. Graphics (8/10):  The game is absolutely beautiful and has flawless triple monitor support. You can see ripples on the clothing, grass and trees moving in the wind which only gets better during raining and storming weather. The facial animations on non story critical characters are a little stiff but the animations are pretty good otherwise.  Gameplay (8/10):  The gameplay is pretty good and the parkour is pretty smooth, it may be no mirrors edge but it still boasts a lot of similar parkour. The melee combat is where the game shines with upgradable melee weapons that degrade over time, you can get perks to help make your weapons last longer but even at higher level youre still watching your melee weapon usage. The gun play is pretty good and im disappointed the guns dont wear down Far Cry 2 style but it balances out since melee weapons do more damage.The night time can be absolutely terrifying right up until higher levels, my first experience with night time was an adrenaline rush even in coop.The game will feel very familiar to those who've played Mirror's Edge and as a fan of Mirror's Edge, i can easily recommend this game for those looking for a new parkour game. Controls:  I'm not giving a score on this since I played it on both PC and Xbox 360 controller controls, so I'll write a mini review for it.The PC controls are pretty good but the mouse sensivity takes time to get used to (i really cant explain this problem) but it still feels very natural compared to most multiplatform titles. The Xbox 360 controlers however, are clunky and take a lot of time getting used to but still very playable ones used to it. Coop (8/10):  The coop is pretty damn good, its peer2peer and you join the client's game and you do their quests and story. Its drop in and drop out so you can leave and join anytime. The \"Be The Zombie\" gamemode is similar to the Dark Souls invasion and can make even the most battle hardened survivors work together. I really recommend this game if youre tired of all the current coop zombie games like CoD zombies, Left 4 Dead 2 and Killing Floor. Technical Info:  This game isnt quite optimized for PC and my first 5-10 hours involved me having a problem where the cutscenes would run at 15fps despite pulling 40fps in triple screen resolution (5760x1080) and apparently its coming problem but looks like its fixed now (it happened to different people no matter the resolution or setup).The game has flawless triple monitor support and the side screens darken when entering cinematics. I recommend keeping \"View Distance\" at the default or turning it down because it has a major performance impact for little effect (it just makes foliage more visible in the distance, thats it).Apparently this game has very very basic Oculus Rift support but I havent tested it until they get something worth testing.\n",
      "I recommend getting this game because it is super amazing!! Playing with friends and randoms has never been so much fun. Different types of gamemodes and more laughter each time you play it. Get it now!! :)\n",
      "This game is AWESOME yet very challenging.1. i found there was quite a tough learning curve to the combat and working the camera.2. i died like constantly until i got the hang of this and then started to really have fun and made it to the 4th level.i feel quite bad for the game since its had alot of bad reviews that i think it really doesnt deserve.the gameplay is soooo fun beautiful art 5/5 considering buying copies for friends\n",
      "The game is fun. Invite friends over and take turns getting killed in visceral, blood-splashing 8-bit detail. The game might not be for everyone; if you don't like pixel art games, if you don't like killing people, if you don't like trippy 80s inspired psychaedelic visuals or collecting animal masks, then this game might not be for you. It's fun, it's fast, it's infuriating and, importantly, it's rewarding.For only $10, Hotline Miami is a bloody steal.\n",
      "This is one of the best games that i have ever played my entire life, this game will take you on an adventure into space with the help of the lotus and your friends and people you will come across this game will be the next goty for pc users all around who love space and ninjas. Now im a pretty big gamer on warframe and have gotten pretty far within on getting warframes and weapons but when an update comes out you just better get on and see what is new for what you will get and even with this one it is just amazing with the new frame and the weapons that have been added into it. And also that not just weapons and a frame but also a new ship as well which is an improvement to having a new kind of ship which you will need to find the parts and buy the blueprint in the shop and once your done making it, you have yourself a new ship. This game will make you wanting to keep on playing and not stop so go ahead and grab this game and play it for yourself and have fun tenno, we are all counting on all of you\n",
      "Ok I just have to say this, I have once liked TF2 but after some time of playing this game i have slowly started to hate this game so much, reasons why you might want to ask me is that i have not really liked the admins of certain cervers (mainly the two pony cervers im on and some others as well) with getting new ones and getting rid of once good ones who i have actually liked. This game is also used for the shop which is used for the keys to unlock these crates that are usually what you might get over a nice weapon or a rare chance of a simple hat. But honestly do people really want to spend over 30 or maybe 60 but not even exactly 100 dollars on some stupid ♥♥♥ ring that no one will ever buy for unless they really wanted to spend it on that damn thing, I say no you can get anything you wanted thats not some cosmetic item for your classes to all wear but i say that these items that i have seen and the new things that have even appeared in this game are just useless, all you get are some weapons or the main thing of hats which i have seen over the time that i have played this damn game. But unlike other games i have seen or played such as CS:GO also do the same thing with the shopping mechanism of the keys and crates for weapons. But as for TF2 I would say that i wouldn't even dare to touch or play this game even if they have made some good buffs but after that gunn metel update it just made it all go away for me and started to not even play it one single bit. Now if anyone would give me a single reason as to why i should play this game and i mean a good one not that \"its so fun and amazing and that you can play with friend\" just like any other game i have and that one of my friends have to play on i want a really good reason that you can easily persuade me to start this game up again once more and to prove that it will be worth my while then i will be playing it but otherwise i am not playing it worth anything even if i were to get an unusual which would cost me something or if anyone gave it to me for free. It's not happening and it is final\n",
      "my friend bought me this game i swear!\n",
      "So I've wasted 182 hours of my life in this game. Getting yelled at by my friends, Hiding offline, but it was totally worth it. There are so many things you can do in this amazing Open World RPG. At the beginning you can create your own character, which is kind of cool. There really is no ending to this game. You can play at your own leisure. Besides getting yelled at by friends and the case of the removals, this game is worth the money. If you ever get bored and/or beat the game, there is an excellent collection of mods at the workshop and a website called nexus mods. This game is highly recommended to anyone who is into open-world games or rpg's. But one last thing, as soon as you get the game, you cant stop playing it.\n",
      "Getting better, still not there yet though. Finally a single player survival, but still need friends to have alot of fun.\n",
      "Great concept, but extremely bad execution.What was fun: social aspect and level of co-op either with friends and matchmaking (sometimes).What wasn't: unprofessional dev attitude, rushed release hence bugs, glitches, and hackers. To top it off, loot system is extremely broken.Avoid this on PC, hackers galore. Developers have had no concrete response to tackling hackers. In fact hackers have no fear playing this and posting their hacking videos on YT. Developers enforce a 3 day ban followed by permanent ban but are being circumvented by hackers simply changing their names. Glitching has been rampant for a while now, and no actions have been taken to resolve this issue also, which means most people are OP in PvP. There are also so many bugs relating to connection, the quality of servers are intermittent at best, while several of the talents do not even work. In fact, sometimes they are the oppostite. The attitude of Ubisoft and Massive are: close threads down of anyone posting any negative feedback, while communicating the absolute minimum: the silence indicates that this game is in trouble. The fact that vendor blueprints are more exciting that loot drops is alone a sign of a completely broken game.I thought I'd be proven wrong by forking out early and getting the GOLD and Season pass, but I regret this. Apart from the extremely brief social co-op experience this game provided, the only other positive that I've gotten out of this game is to never every buy a game and season pass that Massive/Ubisoft have laid their dirty little fingers on.\n",

      "Surprisingly, it's a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind've only wanting the other games in the bundle. So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, \"oh Simcity, right?\" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; \"victim's family will become enraged\" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my \"mandate had run out\", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, \"what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!\" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with \"build a city\". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!\n",
      "TF2 is a great game to play with your friends and is free! There are all different classes and there is even a mode where you fight robots! So i suggest you get this game!\n",

      "Basically Dead Island v2.Better graphics, good voice acting, story just good enough.The parkour system here is on par if not better than Assassin's Creed but in firrst person. Everything is fluid and simple.The combat is less \"rewarding\", the early weapons suck even more than in Dead Island and progression is a bit slow. You're punished via Stamina much more heavily.There's a better leveling system (think Oblivion) you gain XP is different categories as you just run around and kill things (agility/combat/survival), the skill trees have depth.The performance is ok. It gets really bad outdoors (40~) and even those on high end SLI 980GTX's are reporting the same frame rates. Needs some patches for performance, but I haven't noticed any in-game bugs so far.Co-Op actually works. I dropped-in games fine, and people dropped-in mine. Night time allows for PVP (someone can attack you as hunter), but you can turn off this mode if you get annoyed. Online can be set to private, friends, public or off.I haven't played enough to give this a score.\n",
      "Gunslingers itself is fun,I enjoyed it when the matchmaking system actually gave us even geared teammates and opponents (which may explain why we only won two matches) But the micro transactions are too prevalent to ignore. Would I recommend this game to my friends currently, maybe depending on whether they can deal with the micro transactions, would I recommend this game if the micro transactions were removed or even balanced? Absolutely. Hopefully with this game being in early access, they will respond to the community’s gripes with them and remove them, because this game has potential to be good, real good. Check out the full review at http://imagengames.com/gunslingers-mercs-for-sale/\n",
      "Honestly, this game was a huge surprise, albeit a good one. I thought this was just going to be another minecraft clone, but the way it looks and the way it runs. Honestly I like it, for an early access game it appears to have a lot of content, and it runs smoothly even on the highest settings for me. Though there are microtransactions at the moment, the devs have already told me they are trying to rethink the way they will do this due to popular demand. I made a video of it, I planned to stop at 30 minutes but I just got that into it that I ended up going for an hour. End of the day I would reccomend it, though I havent tried multiplayer as none of my friends have it... yet :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6j9mm3Q6cA\n",
      "for a free 2 play game i must say it is fun i play this alot with my friends and there's alot to do and now that there's a workshop for the game there's alot more to do it my not look like the best game in the world but the gameply is good building stuff in the game is amazing\n",
      "I loved this game. It was really fun with friends, I didn't even mind the microtransactions as much as other people though they are by far the worst point of the game.My problems started late 2015 when I started to realise that my hard drive was full. I do, like a lot of people, have a lot of other larger games installed so I checked them to see if that was pushing me over quota. They weren't. I then checked some of the smaller games, one of which was Payday 2. It now holds the record of being the largest game that i've ever installed, and since every new microtransa- I mean, 'update' they add puts another 5gb-9gb on my disk, I decided to uninstall.The microtransactions, while I didn't find them irritating at first, now they are holding the game down. The GOTY edition helped, but 'helping' a problem and 'fixing' a problem are two different things. On a 75% off sale, the DLC is $33. Unacceptable. Don't get me wrong though, this is a fun game, and I've sunk 257 hours into messing around with mates as a result of that. But the things that turned us away from this game are the over-priced microtransactions, the high file size and repeated broken promises made by the lying developers that we used to trust and respect.\n",

      "This is as close as I'm going to get in regards to have Scott Pilgrim vs the World on PC. That being said Phantom Breaker is its own game and what a fun game it is.It's a beat-em up game with anime-like characters and awesome chip-tune music. The Game can be a bit repetive for some but I love it none the lessPros: -Music-Characters: really fun to use and you can unlock more of them in storymode-2D graphics look gourgeous-Gameplay-Stages are really nice.-Multiplayer (haven't really tested it since at the moment its only local at the moment)-Skill Point system-Lengthy: not one of those games you can really complete in one day.-Making combos is awesome.Middlepoint-Later enemies are reskins of previous ones but they have their differences and look interesting. Not just some palette swap-Controls and mechanics are a bit confusing in how they work but it's enough to have fun with.-The Storymode for a single character can go on for a bit, not to long but your hands will get a tad bit tired afterwards.- The game tends to bunch a crapload of enemies into one room and with the weird guarding mechanic working only for some attacks it can get a bit difficult. Still you should enjoy beating the hell out of them with combos.- The Story is bloody confusing for these characters. Either way still interesting.Cons-Remember when I spoke about the whole controls and mechanics thing. Yea some attacks it will block but for bigger guys or stronger attacks dodging it is very hard. Not to mention dodging itself is difficult and you can be beaten the crap out of by enemies. -You will find later on these weird blue/red ball enemies that have these tape claws or something. The mechanics make it either very difficult or impossible to avoid their attacks. That might just be me but its annoying none the less.-You better have a Controller for this because this is one of those games where the PC keyboard inputs are placed in weird places, The control help shows a console controller and you can not change the inputs at all. So yea, Have fun.-Difficulty Spikes on these bosses go up quite a bit and with the confusing mechanics. It can be difficult.As you can see this game has quite flaws but don't let that stop you. I had a lot of fun playing this and with the online mode being annouced recently, maybe soon I'll have friend to play with. It's my kind of game. maybe not to all, but at least to me. Though I would recommend buying it when it goes on sale like what I did.Overall I think the game gets a 7/10. Not the best but no where near bad at all. Bad is not a word you would describe this game with. (maybe the controls but I digress)\n",
      "What the hell is Square Enix doing? They make this incredible game that is eaisily as good as (Or better than) the latest Final Fantasy, Murdered Soul suspect or Lara coft and don't give it any publicity.

      "Game is Very good, some multiplayer issues. Mainly lag and connecting but tou can fix your \"Failing to Connect issue\" by verifying your files (it only takes less than a second).Pros and Cons:+ Boss Fights.+ Good amount of weapons.+ SoundTrack is Awesome.+ Multiple types of zombies to kill.+ Character Customization.+ Leveling up system.+ Character and Weapon upgrades.+ Character Customization (Appearance).+ The Sounds in the game are good.+ \"Mystery Fridge\" (gives you a random weapon or meat, or it can just teleport somewhere else on the map).+ Upgrade Machine to upgrade your lovely weapons :)+ Bots are Amazing (path finding for them is kinda strange but they know how to shoot a gun)+ Edit the way the Bots look.+ Achievements give ZKW coins that allow you to buy weapons, weapon upgrades, clothing for your character and more. There is acutally a point to getting these achievements.- 4 Maps only (more will be added in future updates).- Can get boring without friends :(- That weird connecting to freinds issue (which can be easily resolved by verifying files).- Server Lag (when you shoot your gun, the bullets have a second delay before exiting the gun).All of the issues should be solved soonDevs are nice people :)One of them changed my freinds username when he made an error typing it :DI Rate this game a nice    8/10.\n",
      "Trine 2 is a beautiful game with truely amazing detail to the levels and backgrounds. The gameplay is extremely creative and that you can do anything using the three heroes, from making boxes and planks to jump on, to grappeling yourself and doing circus acts, to charging your way through boulders and throwing Thor-like hammers. In my opinion, this game is best experienced with a friend. I highly recommend this game to anyone.\n",

If that does not hook u in there is also a very \"fun\" multiplayer section which i can grantee that no one plays that mode. all jokes aside i strongly feel that u should play this game as it is really fun to play espically the customisation of guns though sadly cant customise your own personal gun like fallout 4 but however its there.This game is really more of a story base game so if ur the type who like mulitplayer good luck \"almost\" no one plays that mode.still i rate this game 69/10 so if u excuse me i need to use some tissues for something private\n",

      "   English review :Best documentary about what is e-sports, behaps the focus is only on DotA, show how big is this place. Who says a simple game can be something giant like a mundial tournament.This movie doesn't only for DotA specially but for every single competitive game. Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   Análise em português :Melhor documentário sobre o que é e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, já mostra o quão incrível é essa área. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme não serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E também levanta uma grande reflexão, será que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, família, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que você gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que você não jogue DotA assista esse documentário, vale muito a pena, eu não jogo mas é a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lançou ano passado e é inacreditável a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que são e-sports, além do mais é apenas 1h29m.:D :)\n",

      "Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.First of all, some history.All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates.Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time.ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game.ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today.Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job.Here's a very good Altis Life server: http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others.Here's a very good Wasteland server: https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies.Sign up to play here: http://www.thezombieinfection.com/Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3officialThanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!Frank\n",

      "I Remember buying this game 3 years ago. I messaged my friend asking for good games for around $15 and he then sent me a link for this. 1 hr later I was playing on a star Wars Rp sever being a noob and asking people how to use commands and how to pick jobs. That sever then shut down and I played on all sorts of severs never staying for long on each one (Apart from Pro-un-Pro which i played 2 weeks on). I found my self looking for another sever to play on when I remembered a lostInPlace video on a game mode called PrisonRP I joined it, Donated for V.I.P and 3 weeks later got Moderator Then Admin. I still remember banning little kids that said they would DDOS me and Russians Screaming ♥♥♥♥ Blat. 1,464 hrs (78 Days) on I remember this like YesterdayI strongly Recommend this game for new steam users or anyone looking for a cheap game that wont get boring(but not if your 12)\n",
      "Just another Great mod that makes the game more enjoyable, I recommend Jman100s sever for just spawning random stuff and having fun with friends. but Role Play severs are just behind it (because I never Play on Them) If you are into role-playing, The role play severs are not what you would think it is not like Arma 3 altis Life with police ect the only real RP feature is not being able not find cars easily which is a pain. But On a whole A very Good mod not many bugs There are not many bugs I can pick out\n",
      "A good zombie survival game, The story line is very good but I do wish they Were in order from start to finish.

I am Praying on L4D3 but as you may already know valve hates the number 3. Many good mods available if you get sick of the game or you are just no into playing campaign\n",
      "Lan PartiesOk So downloading this game it seemed frightening at first with the controls and gameplay style. But now after playing 10 mins of the game I’m already loving it. I see that this game has a massive future in gaming with lots of friends. One of the first games that I’ve seen which allow many users to play at the same time on the same screen. Also the fact that people can play on their phones, tablets also allow everyone to join in and participate in the game.The Game's FutureOk so, the online community is very friendly indeed. I’m always seeing heaps of open servers that are packed with friendly and fun people. With all of this taken into account, I see a very good future for this game. It’s one of many which provide a unique lobby of 16 players with heaps of custom power-ups, interesting maps and characters. Hopefully with more to come. This game has a huge amount of potential. With 4 possible game modes already, adding more would make this game even more interesting (if that’s possible).I recommend this game for everyone to try out. Its defiantly one that'll provide enjoyment for hours on end.\n",
      "An absolutely amazing game!While a little glitchy at times the gameplay is unique, creative and incredibly fun.You may find yourself killing people while performing stunts, racing to get all the checkpoints, delivering the breifcase, or even jumping off buildings with friends and enemies alike in a falling battle!10/10 would recommend to every FPS fan and casual gamer.\n",
      "Great game if you dont have this then go get your wallet and spend $0.00 this game is amazing and it may be boring at first but when your building and play games with friends this game is ♥♥♥♥♥ awesome!!! share this with your friends and get addicted!!\n",
      "The transistion from visuals to audio is what makes this great. For three games, I had nothing but cameras to keep myself safe and learnt when to look and when to focus on what was near my office. Now, all I have is my skill and my headphones to guide me to 6AM. I love that. During the last three games, there was a point where you would eventually get jumpscared so many times that they would become numb and somewhat frustrating. That is not a problem here.Here, you are always on your toes. You must think, you must listen and making the slightest mistake will kill you. Here in FNAF4, it is not about chance and luck like the last three games. It is up to you as the player to make the right decision; do you open the door or flash down the hallway and pray that Fredbear and friends are not lurking in the shadows? You need to be damn good to survive this nightmare.Rating: 9/10. Series As a Whole: 1 > 4 > 2 >3.If you enjoyed the last three games, get this. If you are someone who does not enjoy the franchise, you will most likely NOT enjoy this but that's fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

While there is still a chance for this game to redeem itself and remove the stupid Microtransactions, I don't think it'll ever be the same. It truly disappoints me that the developers have turned this amazing game into \"pay to win\" crap. I would like to thank the developers for allowing me to have fun with friends, meet lots of new ones with this game, but now, I'm done with this game. This was such a great community, but it feels like Overkill has truly ruined it and angered a lot of people, including yours truly. Maybe eventually they'll see how silly this idea is and remove the microtransactions, but one can only hope. After all, we were promised from launch that we wouldn't have to deal with microtransactions. This is truly a disappointment, and I'm sorry to anyone else who feels this way. I feel your pain.Original Game: 9/10.Now: 4/10.\n",
      "NOT WORTH $70, WAIT FOR PRICE DROP. The single player is a fun experience with no real problems, so read on. Okay, so you are wondering if GTA ONLINE would be a fun experience... Well it is, if you can actually make it into a server without the game putting you in singleplayer for no reason... My favourite is when you connect to a server but the Rockstar cloud services screw up and you can't save any progress :^( What's the point of waiting for those incredibly long loading screens for something that is just stuffed?...You run out of stuff to do eventually Heists become a chore or (mostly) unplayable if you don't have friends there, races and stuff are always won by sweaty plebs that do nothing but learn each race track all day and to top it all off, hackers can hack with ease and with little indication of slowing down... Yes, they remove your guns, can't be killed, spawn NPCs and other objects and also have the ability to blow up everyone on the server at once, thus making the freeroam experience broken as hell.DO NOT buy this game until a price drop even if bonus GTA online cash is offered... You can always buy cash cards later (or better yet just play the game...)The fact that we waited for a PC release this long and the game has just been broken after a recent patch (not the first time) is sad... I hardly play this game anymore...\n",

      "Ok so, the game is actually great but the review I'm writing is specifcally about the new update which to be quite honest was absolutely ♥♥♥♥. Valve brought in a new gun, the Revolver. This weapon on first glance is pretty cool although it might need a few tweeks. The area in which is ♥♥♥♥ about this game is the new way the game is displayed. A lot of my friends think that maybe the graphics are worse now as well. Also the crosshair is different and I'm speaking for myself and a lot of my friends when I say that it is so so so bad. Honestly the new crosshair is terible. If there was one thing Valve could take from this review it would be please oh please change the crosshair back. The old one really was much better in every way. Thanks for reading if anyone actually is.\n",

Too many to list here.Cons:I don't like how you can:die and lose 2+ hours of progress...be betrayed by your friend/s...get into a firefight with bandits who seem to have extreme gear...drive in a car and park it on a wooden floor/foundation and then it breaks...those are the only ones I could think of.Thank you to the readers who spent their time reading my review.Also a big thanks to Nelson Sexton for making the game.(8/10)\n",

      "While I don't play it anymore, Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. It's fun and has a surprising amount of backstory with the comics and \"Meet The\" videos. Every class feels different and is well balanced (Can't say the same for some items, though) and the modding community makes the game even greater by adding new content such as skins, new gamemodes and new models. Team Fortress 2 is a game that everyone should try out and play with friends.4/5\n",

      "Bad Company 2 is a more than acceptable instalment in the acclaimed Battlefield series. The game features a solid, enjoyable campaign that visits varied locations and harnesses an abundant range of weapons which raise the quality of what could otherwise be a stereotypical, conventional and ultimately dull set of missions. Movements and gunplay is fairly smooth and rarely descends into frustrating territory. Locations pop with colour and life, and there's a bona-fide sense of realism present throughout the environment, even when the mission you are completing is anything but. The real highlight and the most popular aspect of Bad Company 2 is the immensely popular multi-player mode. With it's vast maps, unique and diverse arsenal of weapons and great team mechanics, Bad Company 2's multi-player triumphs over its counterpart and frequently compared franchise Call of Duty in many respects. Teams feel more close-knit and dependant on each other than most other multi-player games and locations feel more expansive too. Moments of tension and anticipation, speculating what your opponents will attempt next are nail bitingly pleasant. Making tactical decisions and planning your movements requires more brain-power and strategizing than what may be expected, but when your plan achieves success, the feeling of jubilation is unmatched. It really is a game mode most enjoyed with friends who enjoy planning out their moves and attempting to execute them with precision. And with an addictive levelling up system, you'll find it hard to pull yourself away.Bad Company 2 is a great game and is a genuine classic in the shooter genre. With it's gradually decreasing popularity thanks to the newer instalments in the Battlefield franchise, it's a smart idea to purchase this while the game's community is still thriving. 8.5/10(Written a while ago)\n",

      "A fantastic game that is now double the fun. Don't Starve Together is rewarding as you can slay monsters togther, create tactics for hunting and have 2x (more depending on the players,) the productivity. But in a hilarious and fun way in can be more punishing. Food is more scarce, there are more monsters and when a mate gets killed, his ghost will haunt you and drive you to suicide!If you love Don't Starve and have a friend or two who also enjoys the game, buy this and you will have hours, and hours of fun. If your a tight-♥♥♥ like me, just wait untill it becomes free.\n",
      "This game is a great game.... Let me rephrase that. This game WAS a great game, wonder why, i'll tell you why.First off, being honest, i used to absoluteley love playing this game even before it was on steam, the matches were fun, balanced, friendly and all out great, even though the 'robot' building was a bit tough, I liked it, as it gave me challenge to buid something cool but allow me to learn from what works and what doesn't, but then, it was introduced to steam.First up, what i though when i saw it first arrive on steam i was like \"Oh, awesome it's on steam now, now i can play with my friends..\" It was good for quite a while, but then they started updating alot more, at first it was pretty good with the addition of armoured blocks and electroplates amongst other things, but, then the later updates happened, they are what annoyed me.From what i saw with those later updates were, new blocks and some new game mechanics and matchmaking, some were alright but others were absoluteley horrible ideas to even get to the development without asking the community what they wanted, as if it's FreeJam's way of saying \"We don't give a damn about what the community wants added, we just want more money\" And this kind of behavior really annoyed me, as for one thing they changed, they removed the armoured blocks, for what, ♥♥♥♥ing colours that you need premium for more than 4 types, or was it the fact they wanted to attempt to 'balance' the entire battle challenge of the game. They also removed the pilot seat, like, that's what defined the shape of your robot and how you designed it, as they likely would've though it being to easy to be killed, they removed it.Not only did they add new mechanics that heavily unbalanced the battles by having a 10sec no-hit repair time delay that allows anyone to fully repair their bot if they stay untouched for 10 seconds, but they changed the entire 'Tech-Tree' so many ♥♥♥♥ing times, it can't even be called a tech tree anymore it's more of a damn 'Tech-Spiral' now while it used to be you had to earn points to select what you wanted to unlock instead of leveling up to get each item consecutively like they've done now, and the fact that they've set it with each conescutive item tier, the price is drastically increased, so most people will get premium to spend real money for ir, I understand that, they need money to keep it being developed but honestly +500% in-game credit price increase for one tier higher in which, most people can't be bothered mustering enough in-game credits to buy alot of those as that's what most people do.Worst part is, with the addition of the 'Robot Factory' which is just a market where people can sell people thier robots so new players that get what they want will just purchase a high tier bot and use that, which makes the game's already unbalanced rank matching, even worse.To end this review rant, if i made a review of this game before it was on steam and i would say that you should get and you should play it but i'm not, instead i'm saying that you should not play it if you are unable to spend real money for this game as it basically a money making machine for the company. And here's a message for the Devs and FreeJam, chnage what you have done to this game, listen to the community, don't just look at a few people saying that they don't like something or they would rather something, listen to the people that actually care, that actually want this game to be fun and something that they can play and actually enjoy playing it,instead of being annoyed by the tryhards with bought robots.\n",
      "An outstanding game that's so polished in it's current state that it almost seems complete, I'd pay the price of a triple A game even if there's only infantry warfare currently, even with that in mind there's so many variations of outcomes,  fortification opportunity and tactical plays, that will never make any scenario seem the same. What's even better is almost if not all the player base follow orders word to word which makes the game vastly superior to any military game out there in the current mix. On top of that the community is mature and friendly and is always willing to help.Summary: This is truely the best community i've had the pleasure of playing with, and will continue playing with to the ends of time. 10/10\n",

      "To be honest, Arkham Knight is not as bad as people said it was. Yes the port is terrible, but its story is still quite good. The only problem I have is the batmobile. Why do you, Rocksteady, think it is ok for half of the game to be based in a need for speed with guns chase? It doesn't make sense. Just make it how it was in Arkham City, that was a better version of this game. Overall, Rocksteady, next time have your original team working on the port and don't make half the game a car game with \"friendly\" as they call it, guns.6.5/10 - Buy it for a cheap prices if you want the game. The port is better, but it still is a car game.\n",

Put short if the game is anything more than 5 dollars at the time just wait until its on sale and help save your wallet. :DAs someone who has over 6000 hours in this game I can truly say it is awesomely fun and running a server for it is just the best way to experience the game with friends.There is also mod support for those interested in modding the game and making mods as well as a whole host of other game changing software that just keeps adding to the fun.I rate this game 11/10 just DO NOT buy it unless it is on sale. <3\n",
      "Oh my god, this game is SO MUCH FUN!!! Left 4 Dead 2 is a game focused around teamwork, and boy does it take this seriously. The population of the United States has fallen under seige of the \"Green Flu,\" an influensa that turns people into zombies, or if you want to be specific, the Infected, or Whiskey Deltas if you're in the military. You have to protect yourself and your friends in every campaign, whether that be Dead Center or No Mercy, you MUST work together to survive. There are Special Infected, mutations of he regular Common Infected, to keep you on your toes, such as Smokers, Jockeys, Spitters, Boomers and the dreaded Tanks and Witches. Then there are the workshop items, which are awesome. If you don't have this then what are you waiting for?! BUY THIS GAME!!!!\n",
      "TL;DR: Mechanics and late-game equipment are good and well-done, early-game is incredibly difficult and the community is quite literally AIDS...Beginning in Rust is very difficult by yourself, even playing with friends is difficult. You spawn with a rock and a torch, and you have to get wood and stone to create tools like hatchets and pickaxes, then you need cloth to make a sleeping bag for a spawn point, or to get your friends into the same area as you, and hope to find that one person who's willing to lend a hand. In Rust, morals don't exist. Everyone will try to kill you for the stupidest of reasons. Mining an ore node someone was nowhere near? Guess what, you died! That guy wants that ore node for himself and he's not gonna let you and your naked body take it!But let's assume you got past all that, you built a base and have your materials in chests, all neat and tidy. You have an airlock for your house which is locked with armoured doors, which makes it all the more difficult for raiders to get in. You find other people who are willing to help you progress with your little game, and everything seems pretty nice. Everyone is still out for your blood, even the people you trusted. You may or may not come back to find yourself dead, because disconnected players don't disappear, oh no, your character goes to sleep, leaving you out in the open for someone to just walk by, somehow get into your house and then take everything you own. Death is inevitable, like in all games, but it happens way too often here. The wolves and bears don't kill you, people do. People who have no liking for anyone else, and don't care how recently they spawned. People who are going to claim to be friendly, then blast your face full of bullets. People who just want to annoy the everliving crap out of you, just because they can.If you're into the community more than the game mechanics (doubtful) then this is something to steer well clear of. If you're into mechanics and willing to lose your soul/morals to the game, go right ahead. It's not my $20 anyway...\n",
      "MY GOD, THIS GAME IS AWSM! Like it says, you can create anything, even make videos, but what i think is the best about this, is the multiplayer (anyone who knows me knows i love multiplayer on all those games that feature multiplayer BUT I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME), no matter which server you choose (australian one's best for me) you'll meet tons of people who just want to create, laugh and have fun. i got this so i could play with my friends, but the multiplayer takes the cake, i'm giving this 10,000/10. (and did i mention the workshop stuff, GET THIS GAME)\n",
      "Co-op is a lot of fun, and there are a lot of different upgrades and customisations for your guns and turrets. Despite this, it feels like there just isn't enough variation in the game. I recommended it because of the fact that you can kill your friends by dropping turrets from the heavens onto their unsuspecting heads, which is a lot of fun. Buy it on sale.\n",
      "I use to play this game alot but now it is filled with bugs and character movement fills sloppy.I remeber this game when $30-50 dollars could get you the best sniper, a tiger1 and the best medium tank at the time the Pz4.one big issue i have with this game is audio, there are so many bugs with Audio, in games i dont get any Audio at all tried this on two headsets my Razor Krakon and my older Gamescom headset and it just doesnt work.Also a really big issue is the cost to play, to get up any line now you need to spend atleast $100+, it just seems recently they have become very money hungry since to get a tiger or a Panzer you have to play atleast 100+ hours on that line or spend ridiculous amounts of money since now you have to pay for all the ribbons before the item you want to get and then have to pay for the ingame item as well!!!also (there are lots of other also which i am not going into detail) now they have made playing solo and with friends horrible ingame you cant switch from a F***ing tank crew to a Recon this is BS, and if i want to play with my friend who didnt buy anything when this game turned ♥♥♥♥, well guess what i am stuck with my LMG crew. What the Developers have done is take a Huge S**t on this game and made you pay for itHope this review HelpsFrom Jukia Ninjadont waste your time with this game\n",
      "Great game lots of fun on multiplayer, especially with and against friends. Lots of strategies can be used, early rushes or build up economy for a massive late game army. Each civ has different economic and military bonuses as well as a unit unique to each civ which can make certain strategies more advantagous. e.g Mongol gather food from wild animals faster than other civs which makes their economy stronger early game making an feudal rush a good tactic to cripple the opponents economy before they can bring out units to combat yours. Campaign stories are pretty interesting as well although not always historically accurate.\n",
      "DayZ is so Fun I recomend This Game to all my friends and everyone else out there\n",

      "Let it be known that even though the port might be pretty bad, the game in itself is great. This WAS a PSP game after all and I'm pretty happy to have gotten the opportunity to play the game on PC than not at all since I don't own a PS4 or a PSP/Vita. The game works perfectly fine for me a runs on a consistant 30fps where some of my friends have told me that they experienced some fps drops on PS4. Although if you don't have monitors that support a 16:9 ratio I'd wait until they patch in all the other resolutions like they did for the 13 series. And to address the framerate issue - just like 13 and 13-2 anti-aliasing is another fancy term for downsampling and setting it on \"Highest\" would make your internal resolution render at 4k. So unless you're running on a crazy setup I'd turn that option down to \"Normal\" or turn it off completely to have an enjoyable experience.Also, Sice is bae and if you dodge roll you can have a nice glimpse of the girls' panties 10/10.\n",

      "Im a veteran CS gamer since Classic CS 1.4. I hated many gameplay decisions since 1.6 including the dreaded Steam requirement(2003), Tactical shield(1.6), not being able to remove the silencer instantly with weapon swapping, and recently, the one I regard the worst decision ever; the removal of the MP5 and Spray Tag(CS GO). Players are now left with T-bagging corpses.The current players are riddled with hackers here and there and mostly play on the competitive matches. These players have hacks which include wall hacks, aimbots, no-flash/smoke, etc...Hackers never get vote kicked because they are mostly carrying their team while typical non-hacking kids get instant vote kicks as soon as they push their mic button.Counterstrike is around 15 years old as of this review and Valve have not locked down the hacking problem compared to many many other shooters. There are only 2 hackless places that exist; tournaments and internet cafes that actively sue walk-in hackers.-----------On the other hand, CS gameplay have not changed and remain smooth and swift, spotting have grown more difficult as player textures blend better within terrain textures since CS Source. The inclusion of party search let you find games with friends but the classic auto balance fail on normal matches as parties of 3 or more get split over the two teams. The workshop is a great addition for instant map download and gaming but Steam accessibility and quality have always been sub par. Its like comparing Facebook and Google Plus; one is obviously designed by penguins but everyone is on it, while the other has class and quality but nobody uses it.- All in all, CS:GO is worth the nostalgic visit. But if you plan to stay, buy it on a new Steam account on a computer that you will never use your main account on, download those hacks, and join the competitive matches.- I would not recommend this game due to one single persistent con; the enormous amount of direct effect hacking activity.Oh and if valve say that they have banned many hackers, its because they have. But also because they want you to feel that its now safe to play.\n",
      "Absolutely worth the 'unique' experience especially if you have other friends to play with. The fear of getting stuck on your way to an objective or during a haul makes it a hell of a lot more enjoyable than your typical driving simulator.And the mud! OMG I could eat this mud. XD\n",
      "Me: Let's play this Co-Op game I found in my Steam Library!Friend: Alright! Let's Go!5 Minutes Later...[I cast a spell combo that kills friend]Friend: Revive me please.Me: Never.[Eventually dies and has to restart][On respawn, friend kills me]Friend: Karma noob.[Dies and we have to restart once again]After 15 Minutes of this constantly happening, we finally agree to get on with the storyline.Once again I kill my friend by accident then searches up spell combo on internet and then kills me with it.I cried.After this, I find my own spell combo on the internet and then when I get respawned, I kill my friend.Eventually after 30 minutes of us killing each other, we both had probably learnt 10 spell combos each that we used constantly to kill each other.Finally a mutual agreement occurred which we did not kill each other and worked on the campaign.It did not last long.After another 10 minutes of killing each other, we decided to work again on the storyline.He killed my by accident and when I was revived, I killed him.This process continued on for the next few hours until another friend decided to join us. It did not end well for him until he found his own spell combos to kill each other.At the time of writing this review (12.2 hours), my friends and I still have not passed chapter 3.10/10\n",
      "Don't get it, unless you go for console release. It will make you rage at the awful user interface, the sudden inability to use cover, the bugs that force you into open combat because you can't vault that f*cking barrier for the third time.

      "Who would have guessed that this game would have been a Free-To-Play (F2P) game? It is amazing knowing an amazing game like this is free.There is a reason why this game is called TEAM Fortress 2. This game really need coorporation between players and a lot of teamwork. I can tell those who have never played a game like this, without teamwork, your team is doomed. There are different Classes/Character, various of maps and modes. Can't really get bored unless your team is not cooperating at all. By the way, there is a tutorial in the game, which really helps.For those newbies, I would personally pick the Soldier as your first-try Class. He uses a Rocket Launcher! the first time I use this guy, I was all like \"Eat rocket!!\" while shooting randomly. Anyway, he does a lot of damage, plus your health is one of the highest in the game. You can also shoot at your feel right after you jump to Rocket Jump. This will give you advantage to quickly get into the front lnes, to get to a higher spot, or just to run away from trouble. But be warned, this trick damages you too. use it wisely.Totally recommend this game for those who have a gang of friends. Starting the game with friends is way better than starting alone with above-average strangers.\n",

Even though this game is still in alpha, I believe Facepunch has done a brilliant job in making this game, they keep adding in new features and they listen to the community. I give this game a 8.5/10\n",
      "Three of the original five arcade games are included in this great pack of classic games (MK3 and MK4 aren't included in this one). Definitely worth the purchase if you remember sinking many hours and coins/tokens in the arcade machines back in the day. All of the games have been perfectly ported. Even the \"cheap\" AI is intact and it's a great sense of achievement when you finally beat all three of the titles. If you've got a friend who's keen for some MK action, then \"get over here\", grab your controllers and duke it out!\n",
      "If you're a fan of Diablo 2, you'll be right at home with this fantastic RPG. Good quests, great inventory structure, pets you can send to town with excess loot and more. Speaking of loot, there is a lot - a LOT of loot. Great effects from spells and some interesting skill trees. Unlike the first game, it has multiplayer, so if you've got some friends who you used to play Diablo 2 with, check this game out for some great nostalgia.\n",
      "Borderlands 2 is great fun, especially with friends. After the surprise that was the original Borderlands, Borderlands 2 had a fair bit to live up to and when it came out it had improved on so many elements from the original.

      "DayZ truly has some beautiful moments:I was captured by bandits with green clothes, luckily for me I also had green clothes and so did my new friend that I was captured with. A man with a black shirt came along and recieved a bullet to the heart because he was not wearing green. I was offered a chance to join their crew but I refused because I didnt have the time for their initiation because my friend was waiting for me at the airfield. I declined the offer to join them in their quest to find people they could force to be their friends and was shot because of this.Another moment was when my friend and I were camping inside a yellow house by a petrol station, we were freezing our arses off during the cold Chernaurussian night when I suddenly saw a massage come up in the corner of of my screen, it read \"I AM HYPOTHERMIC,\" I proceeded to remove all of my items so that my friend could axe me in the head and thanks to one of the many bugs I could respawn naked under a nearby bridge just to run back and regain my items. He began swinging his axe back and forth, he hit my chest, shoulders, legs and just about everything before my character finally died.People speak about DayZ being full off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bandits but there are also kind souls out there. My companion and I had just been resting in a nearby bus stop to wait out the rain when we came across a fellow survivor. I proceeded to punch him in the head because I was bleeding and needed rags and he so kindly after being hit many many times gave me the rags I needed to live. We became friends with this survivor named Frost and he continued to assist us in future endeavours such as when we were cold he would find us a jacket, when we were hungry he would give us spaghetti and even when we needed to blow off steam he would suffice as a human punching bag. Truly, DayZ is a game of beauty.In conclusion I think that DayZ is worth your money if you really want to experience what friendship truly means. ♥♥♥♥ING GET IT ♥♥♥♥ZZZ YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH 10/10\n",

      "If I could give this game 0/10 stars I would, hell if I could rate this game as the worst game ever created I would. First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we'd think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. Well, no. This game feels like it had about 10 million dollars in the graphics department and maybe 10000 dollars in the bugs/glitch avoidance, gameplay, story line, and online matchmaking departments. The game is terribly optimised especially for PC and the reviews it got on every professional gaming website/magazine was 100% f***ing paid for! 9/10 on some websites? B*****it! The worst part about this game is the part that everybody wants, the damn multiplayer. Now this has more issues than anything in the game. When you think about the issues with other multiplayer games you think of  things such as bad servers, ping issues, or just bad ping/lag compensation. Well, this game has all of those and more! If you're looking to play a game with more than one of your friends then this is definitely not the game you're looking for. Around 90% of the time you try to join someone else's lobby with more than one person already in it, it starts a s**t storm of errors for you and your friends. Constant error messages saying \"error lobby is full\" (even if you're the only one in the lobby) and it might as well just say \"error go f**k yourself\". Matchmaking also brings along a great new feature called \"get screwed over by the same person several times in the span of 10 seconds!\". Now this is a fantastic little thing that COD has added to their online mode and it allows you to be spawn f***ed by the same player over and over again until you just want to Alt + F4. Their respawn system is so insanely broken that sometimes you just spawn in the middle of a bunch of enemies, which sounds great for some people because you can just spray them down but that's never the case. Finally this online mode brings a final, new way to be screwed over by anyone you run into because well lets face it, you're **t at this game. But hey I don't blame you! When you're level 1 you're constantly being bombarded by a bunch of 4 times prestiged players who have no life or are just really damn good at the game. Honestly, kudos to them for getting such a high level so quickly but at the same time screw you Activision! Starting players can barely start until they're around lvl 10 and get a half decent gun with some attachments and by then your KD and Win/Loss ratio is already f***ed beyong repair. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the damn game until you have at least spent a solid s***ty night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.\n",

Csgo is one of the only games i know that has recoil and spray patterns. Its very beginner friendly because people have to play deathmatch or casual first. But what if there was unranked competitive? Wouldnt that change the game so noobs can easily learn to play competitive instead of casual.\n",

      "Rocket League, you know exactly what it is. That game you see so many Twitch streamers playing, the game that many are calling 'the future of eSports'. It's a game with a simple design and a simple premise; score goals and defend your own. Yes, it is basically soccer with pimped-up RC cars. But, the question is, is it as good as everyone says it is? Well, let's look at the pros and cons first:Pros: -Fast-paced and fun action (especially with teams of three+) -Online and local multipayer (for all you splitscreen fans out there) -A wide range of cars and unlockables (including hats, antennas, boosts, and paint-jobs) -Cheap DLC with great content (for those who feel like expanding their garage) -A *mostly* friendly online community (every now-and-then there is a racist 12-year-old) -Many options for a custom game mode (lowered gravity, different ball shape, etc.) -Ability to save replays at the end of each match (for those sweet goals you want to keep)Cons: -Premium cars (DeLorean and Batmobile) can't have added accesories -Camera functionality (Ball Cam) can be a little annoying (blocked by walls, etc.) -Bots can sometimes be a little too accurate (predict where the ball is going to land after you hit it)As you can see, there are more pros to Rocket League than cons. It is a fun game, to say the least, and in my short time playing it I have never once found myself thinking \"this is boring, I'm gonna play COD instead\". So if you are a fan of action-packed multiplayer games with RC cars that fly about the place, this is the game for you. If you are a fan of multiplayer games in general and want to play something fun, this is the game for you. If you want to start up your Twitch channel and get subs quick, this is the game for you.Rocket League = 9.5/10\n",
      "I'm gonna start off this review by saying that once the singleplayer has been completed (i.e. to 100% game completion), the only real reason to ever return to it is because of the mods. Speaking of the singleplayer, the campaign in this game is definitely 10/10. The missions are engaging, fun, and at times challenging (especially playing through the entire game in first-person). But yeah, once the singleplayer is done, the only saving grace (and I use that term very lightly) is the Online. Since this game has been out for coming up three years now, the rest of this review is more for the Online part. So...The Pros:-A wide range of vehicles to unlock and customise-Penty of apartment space to store your collection of vehicles-A variety of activities to play with randoms, friends, or crew members-If you have a creative mind, you will never find yourself without something to doThe Cons:-At least 3 in 10 players are hackers-Rockstar Made content (missions, races, etc.) do get repetitive after multiple playthroughs-Earning money in Online does require a lot of playtime-Only three of the Heists are worth playing (the first three)There's probably more detail I could go into, but for the moment I'll leave it here. If you're looking for a game with a good campaign and fun online mode, this is almost definitely the game for you. Although I gave the story a 10/10, the game as a whole falls to an almost solid 7.5/10 (maybe higher if a singleplayer DLC is ever announced for release).\n",
      "Saints Row IV...how would I describe Saints Row IV? I would describe it as: Awesome, a lot of fun, hilarious and brilliant. Although it does forget the realism (almost completely) in the SR series, it opens for a lot of opportunities such as: Super Powers and aliens. Run and jump around an invaded Steelport, fighting the police and aliens with customisable weapons, vehicles and of course super powers. Telekinesis, fireballs and stomping are only highlights of what mayhem you can cause with the press of a button. Open up your game for friends to join in on the action, LAN or Online. They can help complete the story and bonus activities found around Steelport. With fun DLC's, the fun doesn't end when the story does. I recommend this game to you because of: The open world sandbox map, the variety of weapons and vehicles, the use of super powers, and the fun multiplayer mode. Saints Row IV is a must get, that is if you are into all that awesome stuff...\n",
      "Awesome fun game, would definetly recommend this to friends\n",
      "Let me tell of a recent adventure I had while playing this with my friend...We started on a large island. Wasn't as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn't bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn't too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, \"Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!\"-pls excuse bad inggris.\n",

The one thing I don't like about this game is that it crashes a ♥♥♥♥ tone.

The game in a whole is less interesting and getting a bit shallow now.\n",

      "Formally comming from the community of TF2 i was introduced to the game by friends. While hard to describe game mechanics by words (economics, strategies, movement), the game does not need to be descibed by words. What it does need is for you to add this game to your libary and play this game forever. A solution to those that don't like TF2, CSGO has unique functionallity that makes it stand out (combat, movement, startegies). It's the perfect blend of Skill, Knowledge and fun quick action. Just give this game a shot, trust me, you won't regret it.\n",

OVERKILL's community integration is awesome cuz if you join the payday 2 group you get exclusive stuff; http://www.overkillsoftware.com/crimefest/ . in the hiests you can go loud or silent with different consiquences like if u go loud you might have to do an escape after the hiest (like cafe or park) but if you do stealth it isnt very interesting\n",

      "Wanna hear a joke? This game. When this game came out around a year ago, I was so excited for a new zombie survival experience. After playing it for a few hours, I found myself still running around the map looking for my friends. I decided I had enough and logged off. The follwing day, I spent countless hours attempting to build a base and find some useful gear. It came to my realisation that the game was ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I closed the game without hesitation and never touched it again.Now, several months later I have decided to give Sony Online Entertainment, or Daybreak of whovever the ♥♥♥♥ they are one more chance, but looks like they have made almost zero progress on this game since I last played, except adding some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ micro transcations (cases: are you ♥♥♥♥ing joking)I can name several reasons why this game is a bloody joke without even having to think about it. Firstly, the world is half ♥♥♥♥♥ and the same structures are regurgitated over and over. It just looks like a complete ♥♥♥♥ing mess. Secondly, scavenging is so unrewarding. You will search a whole ♥♥♥♥ing neighbourhood of houses that look exactly the same and find ♥♥♥♥ all. Thirdly, the devs frankly don't give a ♥♥♥♥ and it just seems like they can't be bothered with this dead end game. The only thing that I can say is half decent about this game is the battle royale, but its certainly not enough to keep me interested in playing this game.To conclude, H1Z1 is a huge ♥♥♥♥-up. The devs are uncommitted and I can honestly see no real potential in its current state, so you might aswell save your 20 dollars and spend it elsewhere.\n",

      "Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything here - I'll avoid anything story-related beyond the premise. With Skyrim, the stories that come from how the game works are often the best ones.It's a frozen nation, just to the north of where the previous game, Oblivion, took place. A briefly introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck!At that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you.Not all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys.The mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game.It's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct.These places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made.The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do.Your first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum.There is also a level up system. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities.They're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll.Again, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing.Levelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle.Taking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak.At the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off.Which is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I RUN!One tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops.While we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.The exception is archery: bows are now deliciously powerful, and stealth shots can skewer people in one supremely satisfying thwunk.What does improve the general combat is a feature I didn't quite expect: you can hire or befriend permanent companions. I did a minor favour for an elf at the start of the game that earned me his loyalty for the next 40 hours of play. Sidekicks add a wild side to fights: an arrow from nowhere can end a climactic battle, or a misplaced Dragon Shout can accidentally knock your friend into an abyss.The Dragon Shouts, gained by exploration and killing dragons, are like a manlier version of conventional magic. One can send even a Giant flying, one lets you breathe fire, another makes you completely invincible for a few seconds. Even the one for befriending furry animals is macho: it can turn four bears and a wolf pack into obedient pets with one angry roar. The main quests themselves are mostly good: a happy mix of secrecy, adventure, and exploring incredible new places. One location, which I won't spoil, got an actual gasp. But then there's an abysmal stealth mission that seems to work on a logic entirely its own: guards spot you from miles away, despite facing the wrong direction. And the boss dragons it keeps throwing at you never get any more interesting to fight - adding more hitpoints just makes the repetition even harder to ignore.Everywhere else, the quests are magnificent. Chance encounters lead to sprawling epics that take you to breathtaking locations, uncover old secrets, and pull interesting twists. Even the faction quests are better here. It feels like Bethesda realised these became the main quest for many players, and built on that for Skyrim. They start small, but each one unravels into a larger story with higher stakes. Some of them feel like the personal epic that the main quest has always failed to be. These aren't engine issues, though. Skyrim is based on tech Bethesda built specially for it, rather than the middleware engine used by Oblivion and Fallout 3. It's a lean, swift, beautiful thing. New lighting techniques and a fluffy sort of frozen fog give the world a cold sparkle, and the previously puffy faces are sharp, mean and defined. Even load times are excitingly quick. On maximum settings, it runs at 30-40 frames per second on a PC that runs Oblivion at 50-60 - a decent trade off for the increase in scenery porn.The games we normally call open worlds - the locked off cities and level-restricted grinding grounds - don't compare to this. While everyone else is faffing around with how to control and restrict the player, Bethesda just put a country in a box. It's the best open world game I've ever played, the most liberating RPG I've ever played, and one of my favourite places in this or any other world.In case I'm not getting it across, this is a thumbs-up.\n",
      "If you like arcadey driving games, simple sports games, and playing against your friends, Rocket League could become your next online addiction. Essentially soccer with cars and a giant ball, this game has you drive around an enclosed arena, bumping into other players as you try to knock the ball into the goal. But in keeping with the arcade spirit, the physics are a bit on the unrealistic side, which is why your car can hop up and twist, you can drive up the sides of walls, and head-on crashes only cause you to bounce back (though, admittedly, the physics may be too unbelievable for those looking for a real athletic challenge). You also can play matches up to four-on-four, either online, via split-screen, or in a mix of the two, though the more populated matches tend to be a bit too chaotic. There's even an exhibition mode where you can play against the computer, and these matches also go up to four-on-four, though this gets old pretty quickly -- well, unless you customize your car with a pirate flag, purple boost smoke, and a sombrero. That's just funny.\n",

      "Ok, so first off, I bought this game a long time ago. Then a couple months ago I played it and there were so many new things introduced, like Telelporter, rainbow torches, and a Xenostaff??? Anyways, they've made a massive change, mostly for the good of the game. (Was kind of getting boring... :P)However after you installed the update and started playing with your friends with the new \"Join via Steam\" option, you'd realise how much stuff you could get. My buds and I were like \"Woah dude that sick! Yeah man, lets craft everything in the game... <Not really. We thought we were going to have the time of our lives, playing a crafting/survival game together, crafting tons of items...Then after about of month of playing, I realised that we weren't going anywhere quickly,we thought that because we defeated the Wall of Flesh, that we were unstoppable with all of the items that we recieved from the goodie bags. We thought that until the Pirate invasion came, that really hit us hard. We eventually got through it and we kept going through the game.A couple days later my Youth minister came, he was wearing sick as armour and had awesome gear, we thought he had like finished the game! But then a couple days ago he said that the gear that he had was useless junk considering who he was up against.Thats when it hit me, bro, this game at least is gonna take about a year and a half to finish, and I have a life to live for a reason. And so that is when I bought ARK: Survival Evolved and that was good, but repeptative... Anyways, there are a lot more other games to play which are better than this, don't waste your money and your life on this. Buy Dota 2, its a fun game that only lasts for about 40mins a match...Only get Terraria if you don't want a life... \n",
      "while i say i recommend it there are a few issues that need to be worked out, paticularly when joining servers with high ping, i havent found an australian one yet but i havent played too much.positives: great car damage, looks really good ! players seem pretty friendly so far..negatives: high ping really affects races, i was in figure 8 and other racers teleporting lots and i kept ending up under the track, for that reason i wouldn't recommend joining races with high ping. I havent found an Australian server yet but i havent played a great deal yet either, they may be out there. regular derby seemed to work ok though..As it's early days im sure more content will be added but im not sure if its worth the full price in its current state, i got it on special so im not disappointed. 6/10 ?\n",
      "after almost a year. i decided to tell you what has happened and tell you what happened to me over the months. ive been shot, trolled, slaughtered, suicided, ive been a demonic sacrifice, and ive been sexually assaulted, and had my knees shot, and had to crawl to my friend to recieve medical help, and ive starved to death and dehydrated to death aswell, and finally have killed over 100 people and been to bandit and back... im a vigilante im not a hero nor a bandit. ill help you but if you dont follow my rules. and you dont do what i say i will shoot you. if you make me mad enough ill handcuff you feed you disinfectant and take your Stuff. ~ Migrant Worker\n",
      "This game is a great game to play with your friends, bad to play by yourself.\n",
      "This game has a HUGE learning curve, if you want to enjoy this game you will have to practice a lot. But once you get past this learning curve the game gets infinitely more fun, it's especially fun when you play in a party with friends (communication is key in this game). There are dozens of awesome experiances you will have with Dota 2 if you put the time and effort into it. There are also heaps of guides and help that you can use from the game or the internet to get you started. Please try this game!\n",
      "Its a really fun shooter tha can be great by yourself or playing with friends. Multiplayer can really require alot of teamwork or the heist won't come together. The skill tree is great as it allows you to go down specific routes for example stealth ghosts, tecnicians and other important components to bring a team together.Overall I really enjoyed playing this with my friends and steam companians\n",
      "Starting off, this game is great, even for the long line of apocalypse survival games all over the Store.Lets go through some headings.Graphics:The graphics look real, but are kind of off. I like that though, because it reminds me it's just a game. Very realistic, havent played on ultra settings yet. 8/10Great graphics that will surely improve before the game is finished.Gameplay (Singleplayer)Some advice. Play singleplayer before multiplayer. On Multiplayer servers, all the good players are already in their own little cult, and the new ones dont want to group. Train a little here.With greatly adjustible settings, you can make it a noob's paradise, or a masochist's dream.Amazingly, the game isn't as boring as other singleplayer games I've played. With enough excitement, loot and crafting, it keeps you playing, even if it is just to learn. Howver, playing for long periods will get you bored.9/10Much less boring than expected. 'Nuff said.Gameplay (Multiplayer)More advice: Have friends who play the game. As I said, the good players are taken, and the noobs don't want to group. This is from personal experiance.Anyway, multiplayer gameplay is just like singleplayer, but with the excitement of base raiding, friendly communities and meetings. You marvel at the complex architechture of other people's bases, before falling into a spike trap. Happened to me once.Finally managing to gear up with help from an experianced player makes it so much more fun, and making daily loot runs is a great part of the game. However, there needs to be more player contact. I hardly see anyone, even on the big servers.9.5/10Brillant base building, exploring with friends and such. Needs more player contact.Gameplay (Other Notes)Here I'll talk about other intricacies of the wastelands, such as the zombies themselves, the crafting, and the base building.ZombiesStandard undead creatures. However, the devs had the great idea of having many variants of zombie all with different loot, such as nurses, which drop bandages and pills, etc. Combat feels comfortable, and weapon animations are realistic. However, Zombies are only difficult in hordes, that appear commonly if you're not careful. They're also pretty hard at night. Then, they Usain Bolt sprint everywhere, and are ridicously hard to deal with in even small numbers.Zombies+Combat9/10Easy-peasy combat with great variance in enemies. Difficulty increase at nighttime is original and creative.Specials.The game has a few 'special zombies' that you should be semi-afraid of.Bloated Zombie: Big, fat zombie that has way more health. Appears everywhere.Boomer Zombie: Same as Bloated, but can vomit acid that destroys everything in its path. Also explodes when you get too close. An actual threat, but only seems to appear uncommonly near the capital city.Zombie Dog: Rottweilers that easily outrun you and easily get you if you're not watching. Appears rarely in everywhere.Hornets: These are the scary ones. I've been freaked out when a hornet notices me, because I have a lot of difficulty killing them with melee and I can't waste bullets on them. At night, it freaks you out hearing that buzzing. Appears commonly near the hub city, but can appear anywhere.8/10Rare enough not to feel recycled, but there should be more types. Current ones are scary enough though.CraftingLoads, and Loads of different things to craft. Ranging from hoes to sniper rifles to forges, the recipes are easy to follow and resources are reasonably obvious to grab and use. Once you have the hang of it, basic recipes are memorized and used automatically when starting anew.10/10Fresh, realistic crafting system with loads of possibilities that leaves powerful items hard to get and essentials easy to make.Servers (I am droning on a bit. Sorry.)As an Australian, I'm pleased to have loads and loads and loads of low-ping servers (220 or so listed on the website server list.) Even playing with pings of 100 is absoultely fine, with lag only appearing around the 300 range. 10/10Easy to enter servers that are reliable and have a great community all round.That wraps up my second review. Conclusion:Buy the game, and nag your friends to buy it too. It's defintely worth its price of $25, and as it develops, it'll worth much more than that. If there's a sale, buy one for your friend as well.\n",
      "Ahh, Unturned.Times with friends building our skyscraper base visible from kilometers away.Making Clive Palmer-esque collections of cars of every kind.Now in preparations in what seems to be the ridiculously large 3.0 update, Unturned is set to get even better.Graphics:I wasn't expecting much from an indie dev in terms of graphics. After all, I don't consider graphics to be super important like others do. But, when I first loaded it up, I was impressed. While not the flashiest and smoothest pictures ever, the environment still looks beautiful, one that prompts reflection on life when standing on top of the highest hill.What's great is that it is going to get better as time goes on.7.5/10Gamplay (Singleplayer)Singleplayer in zombie survival games never work out so well, because its such a depressing concept, being alone in the apocalypse. Plus its boring. However, Unturned somehow manages to turn SinglePlayer into a semi-enjoyable experiance, unlike many other games.I used it to learn the basics of crafting and building, but past that, I didn't play it.6.5/10Gameplay (Multiplayer)Well... First time encounter of a FRIENDLY player in zombie survival games. Depending on others to make the experiance better for everyone.Looting together, driving together, it all so fun. I have yet to participate in a drive-by shooting :P64 player servers on PEI map. Welcome to Unturned: FPS version. Fun as heck, encountering players every two minutes really does keep your guard up.However, loot scarceness on bigger servers needs to be improved. Competing with 63 other players for a can of cola is not as fun as it sounds.Thanks to my acquantinces Slip, Overlad1 and a couple of other peeps for hosting a private server for me.9/10 (Mainly due to  Friendlypocalypse :D)World DesignPrince Edward's Island is beautifully designed for travel, and lots of it. Towns made to seem real and like someone actually lived there once is a big plus.Storyline, even though so small, fits well with the map (Military destroy Confed. Bridge to stop spread, etc.)For some reason, I haven't found anything regarding the lore. More of that please :)8/10ConclusionUnturned is a great game if you need an alternative to DayZ (Because of DayZ's PEGI 18 rating. That's right kids.)Might want to hold off a week to wait for that big 3.0 update to finally arrive.imgoodatgaming, signing out.\n",
      "So orgininally I gave this a thumbs down, because it just didn't have enough levels (and it DOESN'T). But more on that in a minute.GAMEPLAY- It's just amazing with friends, the co-op is some of the best I've ever seen. There's a steady leveling system that keeps you playing the same levels over and over.Now to the con-I don't care what the fanboys of this game say, there isn't enough ♥♥♥♥ing levels in this game. There's what, 8 with the dlc included, six without it? There just isn't really enough levels. And if you don't buy dlc, have fun with the same 6 heists over and over and bloody over. I just can't excuse it. After like three days of owning this game, I'm already moving on to payday 2 with my friends. Just keep that in mind.\n",

      "I personally liked the game, however the building can become quite annoying, for example there’s no easy way to demolish reinforced walls and having to use C4 isn’t particularly that accurate or safe. But RUST is defiantly an outstandingly fun game. the giggles of random stuff of plan stupidity, accidental death and sinking mindless hours into creating, designing, building, planning, scavenging, hunting, crafting and surviving throughout the vast lands to sun rise and sun set. coming along dangerous situations, avoiding death at all cost, making friends and enemies. Defiantly worth $10 on the lunar sale that was recent.      --------------------------->COULD USE MORE UPDATES! <----------------------------------------------                                                                                                  .ASAP.                                                                                           9/10 SUH DUDES\n",
      "WARNING! BAD SPELLING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!to start off with, if you dont like 2D games, then you sir have no opinion on games. 2D or 3D i love it.Very Good Game! love the story, love the fact that i didnt crash once. 9/10Pros:Story line is very exciting and in depth, didnt once drag on (with the exception of the scanning for objects of course but if you dont have to search for clues then the entier concept of starbound would be ruined, you have to go from planet to planet and that is something that you shouldn't avoid)Crew members are nice to have along with you but you should be able to upgrade them, like add a new type of guy called 'arms dealer' and have him build you guns and then you can mod your crewThis game has a great potential, there could be ship fights, where it goes along the style of FTL where you can repair damage (and then the mechanic can have something else to do) and also fire upon the enemy and teleport onto their ship. there could also be inter dimentional planets where you can build a demention hopper tat can hop in and out of dimentions.adictive as crack (litteraly)Cons:Removed Mech :(They removed my love, mech suits, they were amazing! It would've been really nice to buy the mech off the guy who made the mech suit MK 1 that you had to defeat. The mech in the old game was, underpowered, there should be like rocket launchers and machine guns and a modding station for it, and all this could be powered by some kind of fuel that is hard-ish to make.Recruiting crew members is a pain, needs to be explained a lot more, turns out you have to build a house (or hotel) for people and do missions for them until they go \"welp i love this dude, i want to join his ship\" you should be able to find people in a sticky life or death situation AND then you can gain his trust and friendship (along with the house building)you cant change your worlds, you have one world per game, you should be able to choose a character and then choose a world, not choose a character and get plopped into 1 universe the entier time.Removed the outpost miniquests :(this game is massive and is hard to review in under 10,000 words, but all in all i strongly reccomend this game to people who like terraria and want si-fi jammed down its throat.\n",

It has some nice puzzles, the efforts placed into the creation of the game is capital, and you could learn more about the development of the game via it's website or by unlocking the director's commentary. For example, ruMpel went around his neighborhood to get ideas on map/level design. This game has at least 4 endings, but I will not be a spoilering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and tell you about all of them. However I think ALL of the endings aresaddening, because just this once I will be an inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Simon the Main protagonist kills himself. If there are secret endings, I hope I can find them myself The combat system is nice, it forces YOU to choose what to use, IE: A baton, a shotgun, and finally a hunting rifle. That was just an example of one of the combat loadouts. Speaking of combat & gameplay, there is a multiplayer mode with it's own storyline where you and a team of polisen trying to find Simon. However, somehow, you share the same hellish relm with our crippled David Leatherhoff in a grey hoodie.I recommend this game to fans of the \"Silent Hill\" series, the \"Resident Evil\" series,\"Left 4 Dead\" series, and finally to everyone that has played, beaten, and enjoyed the half-life mod, \"Afraid of Monsters\".\n",

      "My experience on Day 1  - This should help you decide if you want to play!Today I played my first my first 5 or so hours of the game and I have to say.. it was a great experience. I purchased the game on the idea of a challenge and a skill cap that I would want to pop but that proves to be harder than I first thought.A friend starts talking to me on steam just as I see the first boss and tells me the joy that can come from Dark Souls. I listen and I quickly see what the game has to offer and I also notice that my friend will be my mentor through this experience. After just under 10 lives I manage to kill the first boss and arive at Lordan. After speaking to a guy who seems to know more about myself than I do, I realise that the goal of the game is to reach a destination of some sort.I then go forward and find that I must defeat pairs of skeletons... who are overpowerd and after 10 or so lives I realise I need to do something different. I go down there and rush.. without even looking at the skeletons and see a shield. I die quickly after and the go back down to look for other items. By now I have realised how the soul system of the game works and that if I die I must retreve my souls from the spot I have died. I level up my dexterity because that seems to be what I need and go for many more runs with each life teaching my more about the combat of the game.I start to give up alittle bit but then my guide (friend) replys after being afk. My question is \"Am I doing something wrong\" and proceed to tell him about the skeletons. He then replys with a quick tip, \"Try seeking a plan B route\". It hits me. I have been going the wrong direction the whole time. I quickly find a stair route that have much weaker enemies in it. My new weakness... grouped up enemies that attack shortly after one another while you are downed and/or recovering. Quickly I begin to realise that they must be seperated and try just that.2 Hours pass and countless lives go along with them. Keeping calm and learning from my mistakes and such. Finally I get to a tower-ish area, do you go up or down? I go up and walk along a bridge area. BOOM, a boss... much to powerful for my equipment and I. So I die... go back and choose to go down and am met with a boss. You know what happened... don't you?!~Day 1 - This game... its hard to believe it was made so long ago for something that wants to challenge you in such a way... and I love it!\n",

      "This game is really hardcore. This isn't L4D or Killing Floor where you run around killing zeds by the hundreds. It'll take a lot more effort to survive here.How? Well for starters, ammo is much more difficult to find. You better make your shots count. Also, you have to complete objectives and scavenge for supplies. If i'm making that sound simple, then imagine a mob of zombies chasing you while you're doing that. A mob of zombies that shamble around like in a Romero zombie film, but never stop coming at you, can infect you with the zombie virus if you're not careful and like I said before, you've only got a handful of bullets (and also preferably a melee weapon) to fight them with.If you can surmount the somewhat steep learning curve this game has and get a game up with a few friends, it's a ton of fun. It's cool to explore the vast maps, scouring the place with a flashlight looking for that jerry can/key/blowtorch you need to progress. There is no ingame tutorial or solo mode to teach you how to play though, but there are some helpful guides with everything you need to know.Oh, just a word of advice, if you have friends who play this game (or can be convinced to try it out), set up a listen server and play it with them instead of playing on public servers. It's easier to co-ordinate your team that way and a lot better for your sanity.\n",
      "broke my controller out of rage with this gamereally fun and competitive (good to play with friends) Just get it - you wont be dissapointed\n",
      "Far cry 3 again splits away from far cry 2 like far cry 2 did to far cry 1. This time you stuck on a tropical island and your friends have been captured by the \"pirates\" a gang on bandits trying to overtake the island but will you go the way of the warrior or save your friends. the 3rd game in the series is definetly my favourite i feel like the devs put alot of time trying to make all the missions fun and the environments look good. even doing the little side quests like taking radio towers is different every time to overtake it. This game has definetly more interesting weapons and the ability to upgrade them and add camo's. overall no spoilers but this has a great story line and any open world/fps lover should get this game!\n",
      "Really great game but I do not recomend playing online with random players even just joining the game and saying hi you are just going to be voted off nothing else. The community of this game is terrible and horrible and all other negative words. But by far a really great game. Just only play solo or close friendsDickbutt. Joined the gameDickbutt: hi guysVote to kick Dickbutt.? Yes Yes Yes YesYou have been voted off.\n",
      "hello my friends today i will be showing u how to get away with murder1.kill 1 homeless man can be black or white whatever next run to the police and say you killed this homeless manthe end hope this helped\n",
      "This is an incredibly versatile game. With lots of gamemodes!Are you creative? Want to build? Play Sandbox. Want to roleplay? Play DarkRP.Want to be a detective, and find murderers? Play Trouble in Terrorist Town. Want to watch YouTube videos with friends? Play Cinema. Want to go on a strange adventure in an elevator? Play Elevator: Source. Want to play Hide and Seek while disguised as a prop? Play Prophunt. Want to play a \"Wipeout\"-esque type of thing? Try Deathrun. That's only a few gamemodes - there are 1000s.Seriously, there is nothing Garry's Mod can't do. Except make me a sandwich. But you can spawn one in.Plus, you can download weapons, vehicles, props, maps, and things other people have made.You can even play with friends and make some crazy contraptions!If you have other Valve made games such as Half Life 2 (and the episodes), Team Fortress 2, Portal (1 and 2), CS:S, CS:GO, DoD:S you can import stuff like items and maps in to Garry's Mod! It does this for you.10/10. I can't recommend this game enough.\n",
      "Do you want abs?Then look no further then Battleblock Theatre.Play it with a friend for an hour each day and you will laugh so hard your stomach will ache.I am sure that within a month of playing this game with a friend all your disgusting belly fat will be replaced with rock hard abs\n",
      "Great game fun to play with friends I recommend to everyone over the age of 15+.\n",
      "[EDIT:] As of the 15th of June, 2016, playing in public lobbies with friends is officially supported, which is boosting my rating from 8.5/10 to 9/10.Dead by Daylight is a very fun and intense 1v4 survival game.Keep in mind this is NOT a co-op game. It is more of a everyman for himself game, but you can work together if you wish.Regardless, we are here for the actual review.There are two teams: The Survivors versus The Killer.The Survivors have to activate a series of generators in order to power up a door to escape.The Killer has to hunt, chase and capture survivors, where he then impales them on a meathook. The Survivor on the hook slowly bleeds out, and any remaining survivors can choose wherether to try and save them, or leave them for dead.The round ends when all 4 survivors have escaped, died or a combination of the two.After each round, each player earns a currency called 'Bloodpoints', which can then be spent in the 'Blood Web.' Bloodpoints are shared across all 7 playable characters, while each character has their own unique Blood Web.Each survivor has 3 unique perks that only they have access to. For example, every survivor has the option to get 'Small Game', which allows them to highlight bear traps at a small radius, but only Jake Park has the option to get 'Iron Will', which reduces the noises he makes while injured.As the survivors get higher in their Blood Web, they get 'teachable perks', which lets the other survivors get those originally unique perks. Other then these perks, the survivors don't have any other unique abilities, and have to rely on stealth to make it out alive.Similar to the survivors, the killers also have 3 unique perks, which can later be taught.There are 3 different killers, with more being included in the future.The Trapper is able to set beartraps around the map, catching survivors who walk into them.The Wraith is able to become semi-invisible, making it easier to sneak up on the survivors.The Hillbilly has a chainsaw. Yeah, you can guess what that does.The Killer plays entirely in a first-person perspective with a very low field of view. This is meant to simulate real predators in the wild, who focus solely on hunting their prey.On the other hand, the Survivors play in a third-person perspective, which allows them to look around corners without exposing themselves. They are meant to focus on situational awareness, and staying alive.The Survivors have no way of fighting back to the Killer, and they have to rely on hiding, fleeing and delaying the Killer to have a chance of surviving.All in all, this has been a very enjoyable experience, and I will give it a 8.5/10.\n",
      "I really enjoy PAYDAY 2, as do many of my friends. It's a vast improvement over PAYDAY: The Heist in many ways. The amount of customising  guns and masks is pretty good, and I also enjoy how many heists there are compared to PDTH. I don't really enjoy how much grinding you have to do each time you become infamous, but that's to be expected. There are some gameplay mechanics that could be improved on such as the visibility in stealth and the sync issues, but overall, I give this game a solid 7.5/10. Still issues that could be worked on, but a good game either way.\n",
      "uuuuh. controls please?EDIT:they added controls, but i still cant play because i have no friendssure its a great game otherwise!\n",
      "Great fun game with friends\n",
      "A great game if you have some friends to have laughs with, if you love platformers then this game is for you!\n",
      "Can last a good few ours in Single Player, but if you grab a friend and enter Multiplayer mode this game will make for a co-operative and stratigicly fun game. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a great game that increasingly puts pressure on your stratergies and will make you rethink the way you play every level. Certanly worth the money.\n",
      "Very fun 9/10Could be called \"4wd simulator\" except they use all wheel drive.  A little more customisation would not be unappreciated, especially when you stuck in the mud with no quick options out.Playing online with friends is very fun.  Of the content that is there i would rate it 9/10 as there really isnt too much of anything to criticise and it has appropriate graphics with a great physics engine and realistic environment change. Your tires can clump with mud and you can dig a hole almost anywhere you do a burnout. Have not seen another offroad game that can compare.Biggest complaint with the game is the need for more content, it would be nice if they had some kind of \"career mode\" where you started with a stock car and upgraded it as you earned money. This may all be to come anyway as the game is new and in its trial stage.\n",
      "I mean whats to say. This game know what it is and it is not affraid to show it.If you want dumb and mindless fun. This game has it.Only thing I can say it requires a friend to get the most out of it.Also 10/10 would stroke my revolver again.\n",
      "I've played for 58 hours, beat the game with friends many times, and then decided I'd reset a single character to replay the game with him again.I then accidently pressed the 'Reset All Stats' button without thinking, and reset all my hardwork.11/10 58 hours gone to waste(Note: The game is really fun, which is why I haven't given up.)\n",
      "This game is one of the best Co-op zombie games that rivals Cod zombies. Instead of slow and tough zombies like most other zombie games, L4d2 gives you tonnes of fast and weak zombies with some special more powerful ones to mix things up. Its great to use the melee for the first time killing tonnes of zombies especially with your friends. Also unlike COD l4d 2 and 1 has that great feeling of euphoria when you either: complete a story part or find somthing good like pills or the M60.And the only reason people really have negative reviews is because of the professional types of player/players which, actually has decreased with more new players coming in and pros now only appearing in versus.10/10 NOW GET THE DAM GAME AND KILL THOSE DAM ZOMBIES\n",
      "2016’s first super successful indie game Stardew Valley has hit the steam store with a bang, as of the 9th of March only 2 weeks after its initial release it has sold 425,000 copies for comparison only a handful of games seemed to sell more than a million copies on steam last year. What’s makes this game so good and why is it so talked about? All this and more answered.Stardew Valley is a game that takes place with the death of your grandpa, and you inheriting his farm. This provides a good base for future plot line. You pack your things and move away from the big city to this small village, Pelican town where you start your life as a farmer, with many objectives to complete.Stardew Valley incorporates many very enjoyable gameplay mechanics to earn money such as fishing, mining, farming crops and animals. Aswell as daily quests with need to be fulfilled within a two day time period and permanent quests. Quests reward you with money and friendship between the civilians you complete the quests for, gaining friendship entitles you to access more in the game like being able to visit peoples houses and even receiving exclusive items from those civilians, the backstory for each of the characters is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don’t shed a tear once or twice. Once you have maximum friendship with a character you can choose to marry them, this also provides benefits such as extra income. The farming is fantastic, you must tend to your crops every day, making sure to water them but then can set up a layout where you can use sprinklers to automatically water them as you progress through the game, specific crops are dedicated to each season and have a set number of day to grow, so you must plan ahead in order to save and make money, The “quality” of the crop is determined by the fertiliser you use and is represented with a silver, gold or no star, gold stared produce obviously sells for a higher price. With animal products such as eggs and milk, machines can be build from resources from mining such as iron bars and stone to construct cheese presses and “mayonnaise makers” that process the animal product and after a short time period produce the product with sell for 3 times the price of the normal animal product, these machines gives you the choice to be patient and wait for the product to maximise in profit or sell immediately and obtain the money quickly.The Fishing mechanic provides a challenging but rewarding experience. Once again specific fish are set to specific seasons, in order to make catching them all trickier the quality mechanic also applies in fishing, but is considered more random since there’s no way to predict the outcome of the quality before the fish is caught, different fishing rods can be used to catch rarer fish and bait can be attached for a higher chance. Mining and combat is a very important aspect to the game. When mining you collect resources to further expand your farming tools and décor. But also allows you to discover rare gems that sell for high prices. New gems and minerals can also be donated to the museum, where for every 10 new gem/mineral you donate you will receive an exclusive reward, whether it be a decorative statue for your home or some rare seeds for your farm. In the mining cave there are levels with various enemies that get harder to kill depending on your skill level so you must work on constructing the best weapon based on your stage in the mines. Every 5 levels down in the mine there is an elevator that you will allow you to get back to where level you left off at, but if you die in the mines you have to start back 5 levels from where you left off and lose 7 items you are holding, this mechanic makes you more aware and cautious of your surroundings and makes you conscious of what items you have and would not want to lose. Every 10 levels there is a new item, that will help you on the following levels, these items can be armour, to improve the number of hits you take or weapons so you can dish out more damage to harder enemies and you progress, upgrading your character as you go. For such a recent game Stardew Valley is absent of any bugs or gamebreaking glitches, unlike most new games in “early access” which is a huge bonus in anyone’s eyes, the music is pleasant to listen to and is programmed to fit the season, and time of the day, the graphics are softly pixelated and easy to look at and the day night cycles are not too fast but not too slow, just perfect for getting everything you planned to do in that day completed.But be warned, you will forget about real world time, and chances are you won't get much sleep.Without a doubt this is my number 1 pick for the best game so far in 2016 BUY THIS GAME!\n",
      "It's alright.It is fun, but repetitive. If you don't collect literally everything in an area, you won't be able to get that stuff ever again. That might not seem bad, but you should consider that about 5 of the achievements involve collecting all of a certain item type. That includes weapons, armor, friends, and combinations of the three.The game has a good 12 hours of playtime, but again, the combat gets repetitive.Also, you shouldn't get the armor set DLCs. They are both level 2 items and you outlevel them surprisingly quickly.Again, my opinion is that this game is good, but gets repetitive very quickly.\n",
      "A great game, tonnes of fun to play with a friend or two. The AI are actually decent on any setting and the maos are all brilliant. Combat mechanics are perfect, the learning curve is quite gentle, and the game has great replayablilty. One of my favorite strategy games ever.\n",
      "This game is amazing for a number of reasons. AK-47 headshot does backflip and has one of the friendliest communities of any game I have ever played. Even the 12 year olds in this game dont yell at you for top fragging and competive matchmaking doesnt put you with smurfs. The 64 tick is more than enough for me. Who needs 128 tick?I rate this game 9/11\n",
      "An interesting FPS Tower Defense game. Light hearted and witty commentary and voice lines. Unique story and easy/challenging levels of gameplay for both novice and experts alike. The Graphics are beautiful and have a very 'Team Fortress 2' look and feel to them. I've logged over 70 hours in this game and have gotten every achievement and I still have new maps to play, new weapons to use and different strategies to implement. I definitely recommend this game as it's hours of fun for you and a friend (if you wish). Regardless of what way you like to play, up close and personal, or further back and let all your traps do the work, this game can cater to you. But whatever method you choose to use, just remember... THESE ORCS MUST DIE!\n",
      "It's a rather fun game on the journey to get to end-game. Once you're at end-game however, the game more or less runs out of new content to offer, updates providing new content do not come out often either. The downloadable content mission is worth a try as it is one of the more difficult dungeons in the game. Playing with a full party of friends you know makes the game greatly more enjoyable l've found. A unique game that is worth a look at the very least.\n",
      "Well I wouldn't characterise myself as a forthright authority on Civilization V but I sure have spent a lot of time playing haha. Here goes; Civilization V is one of the best games I have ever played and I recommend it to anyone looking for an extensive, vivid game that really challenges you. In my opinion, Vanilla Civ (just Civ5 without the DLC Brave New World) is pretty good but doesn't realise its full potential until you've got Brave New World; it changes the ways victory can be achieved adds on a neat amount of civs etc.This game has it all; a brush on combat that isnt overly complex but is still detailed nonetheless, u can defeat your opponents through cunning diplomacy or by overwhelming them with your superior culture.Civ5 is a pretty extensive game; and yes, one game can take quite a few hours so it's not for the lighthearted. Whether you play with friends or just Single Player, this game is bound to give you hours (or hundreds of hours) of fun and excitement, definitely worth in value as opposed to other games that you might play for a few hours and burn out.This is a game you can fondly go back to time to time and still derive great fun from; 10/10 Must Buy\n",
      "Absolutely fantastic game. A fantastic 'friends-and-couch' game. Even better with alcohol.\n",
      "Insanely fun with some friends. 100% recommended.\n",
      "Another great game by Valve, Team Fortress 2 to me seems like an FPSRPG (First Person Shooter Role Playing Game) because you can choose between 9 classes, each with different special abilities. You can also buy, find and do something else that I am not aware of to get items which range from humorous hats to show off to your friends, to curious crates which may hold something special within. I definately recommend this game to all you pyrotechnicians and assassins and everything in between because this will give you endless hours of fun.\n",
      "this is the type of game that can make anyone addicted especially a low life like me gameplayin team fortress 2 you play as one of the 2 teams red or blue and choose beetween nine classes each having a specific role the speedy scout, the idiot soildier, the mysterious pyro, the drunken demoman, the russian badass slash cuttie patotie heavy, the layback egghead engineer, the helpfull though slightly crazy medic, the australian steriotype sniper, and  the fancy guy that looks more like he should belong in payday then he does in a game spy. you can collect weapons to dominate your oponents and HATS dont even get me started on hats theres a good reason as to why this game is also known as hat simulator there are so many hats that not having one is considered a sin no matter how good you are at the game if you have no hats or are running around wearing a gibus with pyrovision googles and a mecanery badge sorry BUT YOUR A NEWB you play in a majority of fairly straight foward matches and different match types control points, capture the flag, payload, king of the hill, doomsday, and the most unique being the rage inducing mann vs machiene this game is high on teamwork and your gonna get your ♥♥♥ kicked if you go in alone. it is also noticable that there are many mods that keep the pros around like the slender mod, the deathrun mod, and the jailbreak mod, even though g mod had all of these first this game will keep you playing for a very long time due to the constant updating of new material and bugs to play around with.characters each character is very different each other they all originated from different countrys besides the scout the soildeir and the engineer that resides in the U.S and they all brought theyre steriotypes with them and theyre atitudes and playstyles are so different its almost hard to beilieve that they get on... fairly well graphics this is not the type of game that consentrates on being beutiful but the cartoon violence itchy and scratchy type gore is in high enough definition to satisfy most people looking for gore and yes there is a difference beetwen cartoon gore and horror gore replayability yes definitly you play as one class you get bored of that class you go on to another class and once your bored of all the clases your ready to try the first class again and as i said before this game keeps on updating keeping valve quite busy maybe thats why half life 3 hasnt been anounced also there are so many mods so many different maps and so many non porpuseful tactics COUGH friendlyism i just cant stop if you want a game that is fun and will last you years before you have done everything and has you slowly clawing your way to the to the top and where you meet freinds/valuable trading partners go for it its free and is very cheap too go premium  gameplay 9/10graphics 7/10overall  8/10 play it!\n",
      "Easy to learn, fun with 2-4 friends. Goes from simple to rediculous in 20 seconds.\n",
      "Dayz has the potential to become one of the best games out on the steam store. The nature of the development progress of the game is so slow and updates only add small amounts of contents and small bug fixs. On the other hand the game is slowly getting better and maybe in 1-2 years time the game may just be worth wait. But for the time being don't buy the game unless you want a game full of bugs. But if you are willing to play the game in a unfair state, it can provide many fun experience playing with strangers and friends.So if you have some money to spare try out the game if you like survival games and zombies.\n",
      "Worth the money, although there are some game threatening bugs... I think that it was worth the money, its such a fantastic game that all my friends are buying it also. Finding your friends is a little tuff, thinking they should setup a friend connection thing so you can spawn near your friends. That would be so cool!\n",
      "A great game, made even better if you have friends to share the experience with. Its a first person shooter with comic-style graphics, which involves not-so-realistic abilities, which are nonetheless quite fun to use. There is a lot of content (you can play 6 or 8 different classes) and there is a number of different difficulties. (you end up playing the game 3 times - normal difficulty will get you to around level 35, true vault hunter gets you to 50ish, and ultimate vault hunter should get you to max level of 72.\n",
      "an entertaining game which is fun to play with friends, people online or just mess alone in the sandbox. recommended to just mess around with people, if you play it offline...well...good luck.\n",
      "Best experienced with a friend, and ideally, a microphone.\n",
      "It's unfortunate that I must rate this game negatively because I had such hopes for this cute little title. However ... it's a game designed to be played online, with friends against other player, etc ... but with a very poorly coded server and constant conection problems ... it's a title that is only suitable to be played Solo. This is not what it was made for ... but it's the only way you will be able to play a stable match. If they fix this serious server issue, which MANY people are suffering from and have a decent server which does not kick 66% of players off every 5 minutes ... then ... it might be fun online. But for now ... it's a free SOLO game.\n",
      "Heaps of fun with friends and randoms, Great game !\n",

This game is a really great competitive game. I recommend playing with your mates as it is more enjoyable showing your skills with friends.\n",
      "This game has to be 2nd on my list of favourite games. I reallly enjoy playing this game with friends. There are many gamemodes in gmod that make this game really fun. DarkRp is a really good gamemode with your mates.\n",
      "It's a great game to play when you have friends or family around because of the 5 player hotseat that is avaliable. Unlike Civ 5, the turns are quite fast which doesn't  mean you have to wait 5 minutes each turn. It's also fun when you have a 3 man army up against a 20 man army and the 3 are winning and everybody around is shouting. Great game even if your playing against ai.\n",
      "I love this game! It really doesn't matter whether your planing on playing this game with friends, or by yourself; This game is allways, ALLWAYS a blast.\n",
      "Great fun with randoms. Even more fun with friends! I recomend this game to anyone that is a fan of survival games or has friends looking for a game to get stuck into.\n",
      "My friend got this game for me and himself, we were playing it surviving for about 5 minutes until we just saw a monster and freaked out. I let go of the keyboard and he fell out of his chair. But this game is alot creepier than it looks until you get 45 minutes on it then you kind of know what to expect... That is Until a giant ♥♥♥♥ing spider comes around the corner inside a building... But anyways alot better than it looks, I would reccomend getting this with a friend or otherwise it is no were near as fun.\n",
      "This Game is Beautiful and I have a pretty low end laptop but I still manage to runit on low quality at 30 fps. I decided to get this game because my friend had it on the Xbox and he let me have a shot at it and it was amazing, this game is alot more challenging and longer than far cry 4 because in that you can use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenade launcher while driving a car. I bought this on sale Deluxe edition for $10 but it is way worth $30 normally. 10/10 better fish AI\n",
      "I Was a scrubby CoD Kid but then i brought this to play with my PC friends and im kinda ejoying it more than any other FPS game would recommend to anyone who is sceptic about Pc Fps, It is a rage worthy game online but youll get used to it 8.5 / 10 :D\n",
      "Borderlands 2 is a rpg, Fps. This game is worth the money but not only is it an fps but quite wacky and bizzare making it one of the most unique and different game of all time. Borderlands 2 contains quite a few dlc that last very long. It also have 3 headhunter dlc which are short and only give out alot of skins and heads for your character.Borderlands 2 has a wide variety of bosses and mini-bosses such as knuckledragger,boom-bewm and captain flynt. Borderlands 2 a great solo game but when friends come on its raid boss time! Raid bosses are tough bosses and usually need a few peopel to defeat. An example is terramorphous, He is a big powerful monster who can wipe you off the map. Some raid bosses are Hyperius, Master Gee, Voracidous and dexidous.Borderlands 2 has a million different types of weapons, Many are found randomly but some 'Unique' weapons which are usually marked with red text saying something about the weapon. Every boss in borderlands 2 drops a unique which you will need to farm for. Farming is when you fight the boss over and over again for his rarest loot. Some bosses only have a 1 in 200 chance of dropping their unique. Raid bosses drop and legendaries. Borderlands 2 is a great game and easily a 9.5 out of 10\n",
      "Sunday Morning, my alarm was yelling at me, but I didn't care, I got my gear and had my average cereal, the phone rang, I went over to pick it up, \"you ready for today?\" said the voice on the other line, \"yeah I'm outside\" I responded, I quickly finished of everything else and headed for the door, sure enough the van pulled up, I jumped in the back, I sat down facing my best friend and old college roommate. It must have been about a 50 minute drive, I was feeling nervous, all four of us pilled out, I went up to scout the place from the inside, everyone else stayed behind. When I walked in, I was met with a security guard, he seemed to be daydreaming, I went over to the canteen area, no sign of any guards, perfect, I pulled out my mask and got out my trusty five-seven, \"everyone down on the ground!\" I yelled, the guard from earlier came over, I shot him, all my colleges flooded through the doors taking civilians left and right, I ran upstairs to find the manager, when I got up, more guards, good thing I had body armour, of course I shot them, I felt terrible, these guards probably have young children. I met my colleges back downstairs, I had the thermite already so we could get drilling, we rushed back across the main room, there had to be at least 20 cops at the entrance, worst thing was that they all shot in syncronization, We all went down, Chains, Wolf, Hoxton and me.7.5/10\n",
      "Jesus, this game has it all.First of all, this is one of only a handful of shooters that offers proper competetive gameplay for people who dont want to make a team and sign up to a website and all that.Second, this game is not pay to win. You can still spend money, but it all goes to cosmetics, so the only factor that differs between players is their skill level.Just a quick thing, the community. The community in csgo is massive, and of course it has its ups and downs. All communities have toxic players, hackers, scammers etc, as well as helpers and friendly players. But the one thing that strikes me about this game, is that the devs gave it to us, and we figured it out from there. We discovered bhopping, trading techniques and heaps of other stuff, and that is what really strikes me about this game, its that we as a community, figured this game out for ourselves, and even found some things that the devs didnt.Third, the skins. Now personally I dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever, but thats just me. But apart from that, the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade. You can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way! (P.S never open cases, they are a complete waste of time and money).If you can get past the toxic players, the hackers, the smurfs, the scammers, the glitches and the plenty of other issues in the game, its a blast.Good luck!\n",
      "Team Fortress 2 is a very fun and fast-paced game. It is different from COD I hear and it may take a while to get used to but it is definitely worth it.What I liked is the classes in generally and their funny personalities.Each class is different in such a way, it's hard to see how they work together so soundly.What I don't like about This game however, is the players. Actual people. Some people can be really nasty and mean. It is rare to find nice people and many of those mean people have the same people; Noobs wearing gibus shouldn't be playing... Fortunately, I'm not a 'gibus noob'.Also, the fact that people don't know how to play the game properly doesn't really help your chances of success.There is a training course but that doesn't teach much. Just how to play to classes. Not how to play a gamemode, the value of teamwork and it doesn't give any tips.But above all that, Team Fortress 2 was, and is a great game that should be played with friends.And it's free.FOREVER!!!!\n",
      "For those not familiar with what Squad is, it's essentially the new version of Project Reality, which was a BF2 mod back in the day and is now a stand alone title that focuses on realism, patience and teamwork. However the game is quite dated now and has needed a serious upgrade like this for a while.Squad is currently in its Alpha and while it looks much better than PR, it's stripped of a lot of the features that make PR so great, but rest assured these will be coming in the future, i.e vehicles. Even in Alpha, the game is WELL worth the price, you're not going to find a more realistic, team based modern shooter/simulator outside of Arma; but in many ways this is much more accessible than Arma, as you don't need a clan or a good sized party to enjoy the full experience. If you have yourself a good team, who work together and know what they're doing, then you're going to have a lot of fun with the game, however, there are a lot of new players right now who don't know how to play the roles, so some games can get frustrating. (Most players here, as in Project Reality use mics and you're not really going to get by without one, so I recommend you have one before purchase.)DISCLAIMER, this game requires teamwork, communication and patience, you might go an hour without getting a single kill and that's fine, this isn't Battlefield, do not purchase this if you're not familiar with the likes of Arma, Project Reality or Red Orchestra OR if you're not willing to learn. The maps are huge with thousands of possibilities and choices when it comes to strategy and tactics,  the weapons are accurate, sound effects are almost too real, teams work together and you can see some amazing things in this game with a little initiative from squads. the community is friendly, supportive and willing to help always. This is only Alpha and there's so much more to come. But for now, what other game on Steam can let you build a .50 cal position on a mountain top and rain fire on enemies kilometres away while your buddies help you with targeting and adjustments?\n",
      "ok i gotta say, this game is by far the best ww2 multiplayer game. i love the reload animation and everything about this game so i recomend this to all myy friends and everyone else!\n",
      "Fast, action paced skill game which requires tactical knowledge to seperate skill levels. The more you play the more you understand what's necessary to be the best. Highly addictive and very competitive. Get started by playing some deathmatch, rank up in match making and get together some friends to build a team of 5 to untap the games true potential as the greatest Electronic Team Sports games ever made.\n",

      "Tabletop Simulator is a game where you are on a tabletop, most people use it to play board games, this function is great as you can pick up your enemies pieces and throw  them out of the universe. You can also be a complete troll and throw the table to disrupt the whole game and make the host rewind. This is great and all but clearly the best feature is the virtual tablet. There is a tablet in the game which is fully functional and works great for porn, now you can share all of your porn tastes with your friends! The tablet can be quite buggy but if you stick to pictures then you basically have a multiplayer porn streaming game. Due to this I give the game 9/10, if the dev releases an update which fixes the tablet for compatibility with more sites then I will be able to bump my score up to 10.\n",

      "Yet Another Zombie Defense. Great game, but sometimes gets repetative, however. This game is probably one of the best Zombie Defences out there, I was gifted this by a friend and I liked it, only played half an hour though due to being a bit repetative, but it's alright. I mean, if you get the trading cards you could sell them for money and earn profit, but I would only recommend this if you would like a 30mins-1hr time waste. 6.5/10\n",
      "Smite is one of those games that you could spend days, weeks or even years and you would never get bored. Smite also offer special MOTD (Match of the Day) with mild to intensive shenanigans and 5 other modes that brings something different to the table. The art style of this game is absolutely great (well, depends if you have a potato, this goes for the graphics also) and brings an almost accurate depiction of the gods and goddesses. The game also hosts or has special weekends where you can earn bonus gems and favours (in-game currency), which can be one of the worst weeks of smite. To top it all off, the game itself isn't too bad and can be heaps of fun (have friends play with you). And beware of the odyssey and treasure chests, unless you want to take your chances (but both of them are a great addition to smite) because your wallets might disappear.\n",

      "War Thunder is a WWII Online Multiplayer that aims to deliver a fun experience on all three types of vehicular combat, namely: air, land and sea (tanks are partially implemented, and naval combat is in future development.) This game is free (although pay currency and premium accounts and vehicles are present), and does indeed look spectacular as a F2P, and generally delivers a fun experience in its existing state. However, as with most MMO's and F2P games, there is a grind for higher tier vehicles and upgrades, so this may turn away some players.Unfortunately, there are some inherent problems that currently exist that can marr the enjoyment for players and/or those who are particularly focused on the realistic and factual aspects of this game.Various problems include inconsistencies with damage dealt or taken, factual errors of stats/vehicle specifications, matchmaking issues (various tiers/battle rating of vehicles intermixing to large degrees), and vehicle performances. Some of this can be attributed to the fact it is a player driven game, and thus cannot be 100% historically accurate unless specific constraints are implemented through player organised events or game mechanics.Some of these problems were present fairly early and still exist, (The developers seem to have its attention focused in pushing new content which has pros and cons) though patches may generally solve some of the issues, you can expect unfair tiering at times.However, I generally look past most of the whole 'pay to win' parts or grinding and simply squad with friends or strangers to focus on playing the game and having fun. the game delivers on that regard and is relatively easy to slip into and start playing, thus I would recommend this game.\n",
      "This game has runied life because of how much i played, i lost my wife, my kids disowned me, and i have no more friends because of how addicting this game is. 10/10 like minecraft with microtransactions\n",
      "The Elder Scrolls series was something I had never heard of but one day a friend I hadn’t seen for a long time came down from up north and brought Skyrim for the ps3. When I saw Skyrim I thought “This will be a great game cough cough”. So we plug it in and gave it a whirl and I watched for about an hour.  After that it was my turn. I instantly fell in love with the game and after quite a while the terrain in the ps3 started flashing blue and then about one minute later the ps3 shut down from overheating. After 2 days he left and I convinced josh into buying it. After a while the ps3 broke and that was the end of that. But then I got it on computer and the story continued and this time with mods. All in all a wonderful game filled with mystery and adventure. A unique leveling system and many quests, the wide range of weapons will keep you striving for a higher dps. The hunt to kill dragons in order to become a more powerful warrior is thrilling and fun. The dlcs will give you even more content and lore.  The open world is also great because as you cross the vast plains or mountains areas of Skyrim you come across little areas that have been put there out of thought.  In the latest update they added  legendary difficulty which has made the game even better, making it feel like they need a dragonborn to protect them. This is an absolute terrific game and once you play it you’re going to come back. Defiantly a ten out of ten from me.\n",
      "Great game, sadly the servers are quite buggy and some gliches this is expected in an Early Access Game, I love the graphics and the map(s). It is fun to free roam around the maps even without any idea of where you are going! This is a great game and would definitely recommend and have already to two of my friends. :D\n",

      "I've played terraria for nearly 300 Hours, Not that long I know, But this is one of the few games I see myself coming back to constantly, I remember when I first started playing Terraria, I didn't Multiplayer and this was a long time ago, I played a mixed class to fight enemies, Best armor I could get my hands on, A bow, best sword I could grab, and some magic, I had alot of fun, now I play it with my friends all the time, So far I've played Melee/Tank, Mixed, Ranged, and now I am playing a Mage, I've gotten to Hardmode on most of my worlds, I've defeated the  MoonLord  4 times, I've gotten to Hardmode on 2 Expert Worlds currently, One of them I did on Mediumcore, and yet I still keep coming back to Terraria, I love this game, It's the best game I have ever played. 10/10, Would play again,Although, I do wish that they would stop making that horrid \"Starbound\" game and release some updates for Terraria, :p Get this game, It's filled hours of content, I mean hell, I haven't even done everything yet and I've played for almost 300 hours, Buy this game now!\n",
      "It's fun, But you basically need a team/group/clan or some friends if you want to make alot of progress,The community is 90% KOS, but sometimes you meet nice players, Hackers aren't too bad, 3/10 players end up using scripts, Normally Firerate/Recoil scripts. It's definitely fun. If you have 20$ spare it's worth it to pick it up. If it's on sale buy it instantly.\n",
      "I got my first ACE today at 11:00 PM, I promised my friend I would get him an ACE, and I did it, On the final round, with a Deagle only, Right before his PC powered down for the night at 12:00PM (Time zone difference, he's an hour ahead of me) And I was so happy. This game can be rage inducing at times, But it is so satisfying to win,    It can also be a gambling addiction, This game I used to think was bad, But It's actually pretty fun, You need to go for headshots though, It's alot different from COD and other shooters, 8.5/10\n",
      "Very fun to play with a bunch of friends and the gameplay is great, all around the world set it amazing and yeah 8/10\n",
      "okey with friends\n",
      "good to play with friends\n",
      "There's not much to say, Some of my friends ask \"What type of game is it?\" and i would respond with \"every, you can do pretty much anything you want, there is no restriction, it is entirely unique, and it is everchanging thanks to the community and workshop\".\n",
      "Best MMORPG I've ever played, 2000+ hrs on steam and another 2000+ hours without steam. Offers so many different things that pretty much caters for anyone, from farming potatoes to fighting enemies on the seas or running dungeons with friends/guild, killing world bosses, fishing/trade pack running etc. For those casual gamers, you can plant seeds/saplings and harvest them, combine them with other materials and craft into potions and many other things. You can also participate in rifts or even faction events in the seas/on land for honor in order to gem your gear. If fighting is not for you, go explore some pretty challenging-to-reach but amazing landscape ArcheAge has to offer, level up exploration proficiency and go treasure hunting.\n",
      "Ive played the game on the xbox and playing ♥♥♥♥♥d mode is so much fun with friends\n",
      "refund/10. I was more dissapointed than my girlfriend in bed.\n",
      "you can play other games in this gameno im not kiddingjust check my hours into this game as well as my screenshotsthe reason why i have over 1000 hours is because this game keeps evolvingwith new mods and maps and moreif you just want to play with your friends (which is what i do the most) just get a VPN program like Evovle and host a lan server.so overallthis game is basicly every. game. ever. put into one game, thats only 4gbbest game on steam 1000/1000also my addon list is now 29gb lol\n",
      "This game is a increbably if you play with friends on multiplayer but to be hinest the single player campain is just boring and i think it was about 3 missions i did before i just got bored and played multiplayer and i say wait for a sale before buying this but the multiplayer is just so fun to play with friends that i think that my money was well spent (i bought this on a sale).\n",
      "This game has a mind off it own. Fram rate drop so much since launch Evan having a high end PC. When having anti virus protection ( I used AVG but now different one) the game love to lock up your pc. If have a anti virus program installed the game crash on boot up or in a middle of a zombie game. The game alright but if you want to play a good cod game play WAW or black ops 1 or black ops 2. I would recommend this game if you like zombie or campaign. But the multiplayer still need a fix spawn feel like black ops 2. And pay to get cool stuff in the black market. If you don't mind the spawn and the over powers VMP pick up this game. This is one of the good cod game in the pass 2 year. If you have a friend over and want to play coop cod this game the only cod that you can play split screen on the pc witch I like\n",
      "This is a really good game so far. Beautiful music, atmosphere and wacky hostile creatures trying to eat your face. The satisfaction to come across a prison with hostile occupants is exciting when you want to explore the place and gather loot. Inspecting things can also be rather amusing particularly if you are a Floran.Mining isn’t really my thing and I ain’t a fantastic builder. I’m a massive hoarder however; there is so much to see, look and take with you on your journeys. Found myself carrying half a dozen tents and flame barrels with me to keep myself alive and anyone who joined me. Took me a while to discover a few features in the game but it is hard to forget them now; such as building an anvil to do much more with your ore. Finding ore can be such a chore sometimes but it has left me hopping on planet after planet to find what I need. Combat is meh, but it isn’t what I really wanted from this game. It’s everything else that matters to me.  Finding weapons that are semi decent is a struggle. It actually puts me off exploring places or even bothering to fight. Because only finding crappy melee weapons that do bugger all damage that wouldn’t push a fat kid off a big wheel really encourages me to fight monsters several levels higher than me. If they allowed (decent) weapons to be found more commonly that would be great. Even a crappy pistol would be acceptable compared to the crappy spears, hammers and swords that I constantly find. I love the temperature feature and hunting in this game. Never played Terraria or Minecraft, only witnessed those games played around me and probably never play them. Because I know I would only be disappointed. True that Starbound is currently in BETA and has things to fix like XP Support and balancing stuff; it is an amazing game despite its weaknesses. It’s pretty darn good for being a BETA.My only real complaint is that since this game has come out none of my close friends want to play anything else but this game.\n",
      "I can't believe I didn't make a review of this game.Now, for all those fallout fans this may come of a shock or not but, I never really played Fallout 3. Compatibility issues and lack of patience prevents me from playing that game, ever. Someday I will so I can see why everyone loves it so much but for now New Vegas is the only Fallout that I've played.This game is truly amazing. First time I played this I wasn't really serious. I bought a ♥♥♥♥ load of ammo and always had too much. Now that I play strictly hardcore I am very conscious of what I own and I LOVE that! The fact I have to sleep, eat and drink is tedious but necessary. I mean, I feel like I am in the game sometimes because of that. Storyline wise I thought it was ok. Clearly the game encourages you to do side missions and DLC more than anything, which I am very happy to do. Finding the best guns is also grand. So far the Medicine Stick is my favourite due to the awesome ammo it uses and the actual strength of the weapon. I mean the Tesla Cannon, Minigun, Gatling Laser minigun and even the Bozar are damn good weapons. But I just love the accuracy and strength one shot weapons that has quick reload.  Even the melee weapons are fun. Power Fists (or Pushy the awesomely named weapon that I found) are so much fun. Thermic lance is also bloody grand.I am generally the good guy in most games; Fallout encourages me to be both evil and good. Good that I help people and get friendships and cool weaponry and caps. Evil that I steal a lot of stuff, pretty much all the valuables that I see; like Skyrim you can just grab it, drag it around the corner and then store it. I have made a game where I am goody, goody two-shoes and a game where I am the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from hell. But really, being both is much more fun and interesting which is what I think the developers wanted people to be like.The radio music in the game is decent but it can get very old really quickly. Perhaps the most important skill to get in the game is speech.  Speech is the useful in getting experience and getting ♥♥♥♥ done in conversations with difficult people. Someone won’t back down and leave peacefully, use speech to convince them or tear them apart. I generally prefer the speech because killing isn’t very satisfying unless they are a challenge.Get the game guys; it is fun and challenging at times. Watch out for Deathclaws!\n",
      "How to describe this Source Mod of Half Life 2...Well first, it's quite a unique game, one that you don't see too often anymore. Purely atmospheric, with some very appealing lighting and graphics. There is little to no music in the game, leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area. Even so, this sets a perfect atmosphere, calmly, yet it still keeps you on your nerves.Admittedly, the story is somewhat cliché, but is still portrayed quite well. As you progress through new areas, you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on, with an unknown company blocking any outer communication. These characters are not always friendly, some attempting to kill you, just trying to survive in this perilous land. The voice actors are brilliant, bringing life to the game and to the characters they play.The graphics in this game are, while not perfect and somewhat buggy, still quite beautiful. There were multiple occasions where I would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon, taking in the quiet beauty. The lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself. Dark areas have a dark glow to them, while the happier, lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them. The infected are somewhat bland, looking as though they came from Star Trek and just have glowing yellow eyes, but they don't pose a threat, they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are there.As a total game, I found this to be quite impressive. I HIGHLY recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere. Considering this was made with the HL2 engine and is only the first Act of many to come, I can only wait in anticipation for the next few Acts. This game has impressed me quite a lot, with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music. As a total, this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community; Atmosphere. Modern games incorperate as much action as they can, sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in, but this game let's you play and take it in at the same time. Very impressed with this game, can't wait for the next Acts.\n",
      "My mate from school gifted me this 'fine' creation.We're no longer friends.'Nuff said.\n",

      "19, July, 2016Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer, competitive, survival, horror game which typically is played as a 1v4, 1v3, 1v2 or 1v1.The setting is in some sort of abandoned park, or field, etc (different maps) at night where 1-4 survivors are trapped and must attempt to escape. The reason why they must escape is because lurking in the area with them is a demonic, cold-blooded serial-killer. The killer who is controlled by 1 player in the match must kill/sacrifice as many survivors as possible. Sounds like a pretty straight-forward matchup. However it is not as easy as it seems.In each map there are 2 main exits which are closed and dysfunctional, as well as around 7 stationary generators spread around the area. In order the power the main exists, the survivors must repair a certain number generators (typically depending on the amount of survivors in the match (4 survivors = 5 generators. 3 survivors = 4 generators. etc)) Each generator takes a vaguely large amount of time to repair and while survivors are repairing them they are constantly under the heart-pounding pressure of encountering the killer.The killer's job isn't entirely simple either. When the killer finds a survivor he must strike them (generally twice) with their primary weapon in order to seize them from running and down them. From there the killer cannot physically kill the survivors (unless a certain \"perk\" is used). His job is to pick them up and hang them on sacrificial hooks spread around the map. The hooks keep the survivors stationary and sets a long time limit where a spider-like, speared creature (best description I can give) forms around the hook post and attempts to kill the survivor. The survivors can be saved while hung up though. At this point in time (July 19, 2016) the killer player can select 1 of 3 different killers, each with a different ability. One carries around beartraps which can be set anywhere and seize wandering survivors. One has a cloaking bell which can turn the killer mostly invisible. And also one with a chainsaw that can be used to charge at and completely down any survivors that make contact.The game as well as being challenging includes many more mechanics and features than it appears. When performing tasks such as repairing generators or healing teammates, the game randomly displays 'skill checks' in order the make the tasks more pressuring and challenging. Upon failing a skill check, the completion bar will move down slightly and will also causes a very audible sound, potentially attracting the killer. Upon succeeding a skill check, the bar moves skips a few seconds and rewards the player extra game points. There are also storage crates around the map which contain useful items for survivors such as medkits for assisting in healing other survivors or yourself, toolboxes for assisting in repairing generators or sabotaging hooks and other mechanical objects, or a flashlight which can be used to blind and stun the killer when necessary.There are many ways for survivors to counter the killer's wrath including vaulting over slightly raised objects or windows, pushing down barricades in front of him and potentially stunning them, blinding them with the flashlight, hiding in cabinets, or planting themselves in camouflaged positions in order the lure the killer away.There are many other mechanics in-game which I would love to talk about but need to keep this review not as long. The game also has a ranking system used to truly compete with other players and become more skilled at the game. There are also a variety of customization options, items, perks and add-ons for the characters and killers.The game at this point in time isn't perfect, as there are many bugs and in-game features which make the game less fun and more frustrating at times. However, what we have right now is a creative, fun and interactive competitive game that tests and rewards the player's ability to remain vigilant, keep focused, be stealthy, stay alert, and be altruistic and supportive to your fellow survivors. And always remember that \"death is not an escape\"Pros:- Incredible variety of mechanics- Intriguing gameplay- Audio gives players paranoia- Overwhelmingly terrifying moments- Greatly tests player's gameplay abilities- Variety of customization and add-ons- Enjoyable when played with friends- Potential epic and satisfying momentsCons:- Some frustrating mechanics and features- Confusing ranking system- Non reusable items and perks- Over-powered favouring to quickly skilled players- Glitches (July 19, 2016)- Not a lot the game has to offer (July 19, 2016)- Poorly optimized (July 19, 2016)7/10Recommended for players interested in multiplayer, survival horror, strategy, and competitive gameplay.\n",
      "WARNING: This review contains spoilers. XAlien: Isolation is a High quality AAA horror game based off the 1979 movie, \"Alien\". In this game, you play as Ellen Ripley's daughter (Amanda Ripley) in a time zone set between the first and second \"Alien\" movie. Ripley and the 'Torrens' must go on a mission to the 'Sevastapol Station' to unravel the truth behind her mother's disappearence. Only to find that the station has gone to chaos, citezins going crazy, synthetics have turned evil, and there is also the pressence of a Big, fast, lethal and unpredictable alien.Alien: Isolation is quite possibly THE BEST horror game I have ever played. I couldn't keep myself from it until I finished the campaign. Most 'Alien' games in the past have been quite disappointing and put every one to a conclusion that there is never going to be a good Alien game. However ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Creative Assebly's 'Alien: Isolation'.The game features a HUGE range of gameplay sources including items found in the station used for crafting, ammunition and flares. A crafting system for (hidden In game) blueprints such as medkits, smoke bombs, flashbangs and some other amazing utilities. A variety of weapons (hidden in game) such as a revolver, a shotgun, a stun baton and more. Terminal cmoputers (WITH CRT MONITORS?!), rewire systems and... Save Stations (which I have always hated). As well as a motion tracker, an access tuner and a headset flashlight to help in your quest for survival.As well as the Alien there are many enemies to avoid in Alien: Isolation. After a disruptance in the stations core, Sevastapols's environmentally friendly andriods have turned AWOL and are executing all located humans in the station. They are indestructable to most of your utilities. They can be stopped by using the Stun Baton, EMP mines, or the Bolt Gun. There are other Human's on the station, alive and terrified. They will kill anyone they see for survival. There are also Facehuggers on the station as well (keep them away from you).The main antagonist of the game is the alien Xenomorph that proclaimed to wander out of the \"Nest\" and is roaming 'Sevastapol' killing everyone in sight. The Xenomorph features incredible Artificial Inteligence that can be alerted by even the slightest bit of noise (hint: don't run). He can go anywhere in the station via the ceiling vents. The Xenomorph is more unpredictable than probably any other horror game enemy I have seen. He can fall out of the ceiling, he can crawl through access vents and he is much faster than you. If he spots you he will chase after you at a terrifying speed and once he catches you, you are introduced to a death screen. There are many methods of occupying the alien, such as   hiding in lockers, cabinets and under tables, using noisemakers, using rewires, and fire...  - \"Animals are terrified of fire\".Although this game may seem like a perfect horror game, it is not. The full game is $50 and has a size of 32 GBs. The game is 15 hours long, which is way over the average horror game time length. The first half of the game is great fun and quite interesting, while the rest of the game is just adding, less cutscenes, more frustrating tasks and more 'I just wanna beat the game'. The game uses manual \"save stations\" as its main source of saving (again, I hate save stations). And the game is known to be really frustrating at times, and sometimes \"unbeatable\".Over all though, this is a fantastic action - survival - horror. I'd rate it a 9/10. This is not the best horror game of all time, but if you don't mind spending $50 on an \"Alien\" based horror that takes 32 GBs space, spending over 15 hours on confusing and frustrating tasks and scares and relying on locating save stations throughout the campaign every time you have to leave the game, then I recommend Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation 100%.If you are still reading this, I hope you enjoyed my review. Now go and enjoy the game.\n",
      "No More Room in Hell takes the survival aspect of zombie survival and makes it as intense as possible while keeping each game short, simple and verry intense.In this game you will struggle to share supplies with your teammates and struggle keeping your supplies off your friends. Its a little bit like DAYZ sometimes with the teamkilling that occours every now and then. but usually the team works seamlessly together, organising the weapons you carry and ammunition, right down to struggleing to punch a zombie in the face, This game is Grit, Spit and horse sh*t everywhere you turn, and I LOVED it!So if you're the kind of person who likes short matches of intense survival and loves playing Left4Dead on Realism, then this game in for you!\n",
      "Even though this game is over 4 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.\n",
      "9/10 Amazing game, if anyone tells you its like minecraft there lieing. It is completly diffrent, its alot better actully. Fun game to play with friends.\n",
      "it is a great game i suggest getting it it might just be me but i am completly addicted to this game i think it could be improved by being able to create your own chracter and and build a base (settlement as i think it kinda suits the game) i think if there where more npcs, quests and a choce feature (being able to change the main story just a bit) i think that it would be a bit better but all these suggestions are what i would like to be implemented to the game but over all i think its a fun game in which you could have alot of fun with friends or on your own (forever alone) in my opinion it is a realy good game but that is my opinion it wasnt as hardcore survivail that i would like it to be there is water food items every where its good if you just want to play it casual but not the best game if you want to play hardcore (chuck norris style) over all i play alot of zombie games like dayZ, deadrising, dead island, state of decay and left 4 dead but also a lot of survival games like rust, dont starve and neather and overall i give it    7/10 freedom   8/10 survival    8/10 graphics    7/10 story    9/10 awesomeness\n",

      "Without looking at guides on how to play this game I delved right into the action and was immediately confused on what to do, so I quickly searched up a guide on steam and relaunched the game. 100% Orange Juice is a mix between a board game and a card game that is based primarily on luck and a little knowledge on how to play the game, this game has two ways of winning to gather enough stars and to beat enough enemies. To move on the board you roll a die, if you reach an intersection you are able to choose which direction you would like to go (After learning the tiles you can get the best out of your turns/chapters). There are different tiles on the board and an action is performed on each one that may benefit your game or hurt your game (Luck based) these include; gaining or loosing stars, versing creatures, Draw a card and battle. I found this game fun to play, however after playing more than 3 hours I found it very annoying how hard the ai is in this game, so I recommend only playing this with a mate who owns the game. The developer 'Orange Juice' used vibrant colours in the game and a refreshing art style that I have not seen by any other dev although the music is great it became very annoying after the third loop. Overall this game was fun to play, had extremely difficult ai, based upon luck, great visuals, tons of campaigns and content and great but catchy soundtrack. Not quite worth 6.99us asking price through for the content in this game however is definitely worth it if you have friends to play with. *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*\n",
      "I just LOVE this game, I just bought it friday, expecting nothing good. When I got on it and spawned way out in the middle of nowhere I thought, *ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME* this will now be just like DayZ..... A wolf then chases me out of the forest and I come upon a road, I run, eh a few miles with no hope. I search through a car and find a can of grammys chickin. So I find a guy, he tries talking on his mic but hes not saying anything.I run into a small area above these plots, looked like they were going to build houses there. I run inside a trailer and hear something outside.... Immediatley two guys are conversating on there mics, I then hide in the bathroom of this little trailer.... I hear two gunshots and hear other people on mics. I exit out of the back and run for the woods....I come upon a small little neighborhood, theres three guys terrorizing another guy, I thought id save him. I got blown up....Me and a friend make plans to go to.... D5, It sayd there was a police station there so all I could think of was guns, lets get our hands on guns.... We travel towards D5 from I7, so were walking through the hills and such, all of a sudden we come upon a house, its pitch black and this house is near a pond. We watch around us and zombies start pilling up. We start heading back to D5 now, we come upon a river and theres 30+ player made bases. We can see this massive town (at the time I didnt know D5 was a massive town, I just thought it was a police station XD  ) So were running towards the town, I hear a gunshot and I got killed. My friend panicked and ran towards the apartments. Atm im thinking of quitting the game, I got killed and itd take me FOREVER to get back here again.... My friend hides in an apartment.So I go to click Respawn and lord and behold, I respawned in D5... Right next to the apartment my friend was in. We found some guns in the apartment. Were running down the street and we look behind us and theres 20 guys with guns and helmets running and shooting at us. We got cornerd, tourtured, and murderd... My friend decided to get off and I respawn next to a gas station, I was then held at gunpoint and asked to take mt clothes off.. Hes ready to pull the trigger and all of a sudden a car comes out of nowhere and runs him over. I then hop in the car and the battery dies and we got cornerd by the group of 20 people...... R.I.P Car Dude...To end this little thing, the next day I decided to play some more H1Z1, I find a zombie and he has an ak47, helmet, awesome pants, and a sick backpack with alot of supplies on him.... Thank god for player zombies :DId recomend this game to my future kids... oh yeah, Im not even married yet..10/10 Id go thru all this hell again just to find the police station...P.S, I still dont know where it is, I got lost then run over by a car in D5.....\n",
      "A game for those who need a challenge. This is an amazing game with friends and requires simply time to master.

      "A very interesting concept with a few minor glitches, Prison Architect changes tycoons in many different ways on how to manage and control things. Gameplay, you start out with a few workers to build your prison and make money to hire guards and other special workers to make your prison better and sometimes things get out of control real quickly. Audio, sound in this game is pretty good like for example rioting which sounds pretty real in my opinion. Replay ability, this game is flesh every time with new ideas on how to start a prison and manage it. Player friendly, the game is a little complex for new people with micro management and guard management can be tough for new players, plus CCTV cameras and programs. Cons, few bugs and weird graphical glitches’ but new updates are always at the end of the month. This game will be a little complex for new people and will take some time. 7.9/10\n",

      "Game really is fun and has a lot of potential to being one of the best zombie survival games but at the moment it has some downfalls. Desync is one of the major problems you can have in this game, not to mention if you end up running through a building, up the stairs and all of a sudden drop dead on the second stair case. Zombies tend to one hit you and ruin most of the gear you have on you (Pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the stuff again). Standing still then all of a sudden hear friends laughing at you because they saw your character walk directly off the edge of the rooftop you were on. But wait, i'm still standing on the roof? Oh wait, no, there's the death screen. Theeerrree it is. Some really deadly terrain, most of my deaths and rage come from just climbing a ♥♥♥♥ing ladder, and i have a good connection. But honestly, like i said, the game has a lot of potential and there's a lot of pluses besides the aggravating zombies and the deadly staircases your tempted to climb up to find loot. And other places but anyway, it's nice to play with friends, roam around, get geared and meet some people along the way whom you'll have to decide to make friend or foe. Give it a try. Hopefully you'll have better chance than me XD 7/10\n",
      "This game is so much fun, buy it!It features on of the best Customization i've ever seeThere is so much fun things in this game, i've spent hours on this awesome gameThe game can get repetetive and some missions are boring and some missing content removedbut this game is a lot of fun either you are playing with a friend or alonePlay it, it's worth it\n",
      "Great game, lots of fun and even better when playing with friends + mods\n",
      "Payday 2, where to start?Well first of all this game is a complete time killer. Personally I can sit here for hours on end robbing banks and going full blown stealth mode in art gallery. This game continues to excite me due to the fact that this game is part skill part teamwork as soloing a heist take skill, that is not the point of the game. Teamwork takes a massive role whilst playing this game espically on Death Wish difficulty missions. I find this game quite entertaining, as upgrading my weapons, skills and perks make my character quite a proffensional :) Overall this game is fun to play with friends and random's, but still continues entertain me :)\n",
      "Wow! So much to say about this game! It is one of the most fast paced game I have played in a while. The game has so many funny moments in it which can be enjoyed by friends and even randoms! Overall I rate this game a 10/10 :D\n",
      "This game is amazing to play with friends and can keep your attention for quick a long time. This is one of my favourite FPS games (First Person Shooter) and I highly recommend this game to anyone who taked intrest in FPS and cartoonie characters.If you do, this is the game for you.\n",
      "If you have ever wanted a game like Super Smash Bros but on PC then this is for you. Free to Play rotation of characters every week, Ranked matches (2v2's 1v1's) Custom matches (8 Players) play around with your friends in intense battles and a store to buy things like skins, taunts and characters.- A great action packed game that leaves you left with no words after you clutch wombo combo someone at the last second and get that promotion\n",
      "My friends are questioning what I'm doing with my life. After 80+ hours all I can really tell you is this game is relaxing and exciting at the same time. I couldn't think of a more perfect combination then Mahjong and pretty anime girls to look at. A lot of people complain that it doesn't go far enough in terms of them undressing and to those people I say you should look elsewhere for your \"entertainment.\" To everyone else, have fun and get clicking~! <3\n",
      "Paladins is a free to play overwatch copy i get it but it has a feel to that overwatch may never get it liek a taco with a bit of competitive,fairness and fun and i would 100% recommend this to my friends but it also has its down sides like when you accept for a game then 2 minutes later get a ban,duping and many other problems i can be bothered typing.The game is only in beta and has shown me its already going to be a high end game.\n",
      "Left 4 Dead 2 is not a horror game. But, it makes up for that because Left 4 Dead 2 is fun (especially with friends and mods), has a lot of replay value (with new campaigns, L4D campaigns and mods) and is super ♥♥♥♥ing bloody (thanks Government).\n",
      "Very nice game, great game tro play with friends\n",
      "Oh Payday I wish i could love you but like a drug ridded best friend as much as i hope you recover, i wish you would die.\n",
      "Tired of playing as the good guy? well then this is the game for you! Payday the heist is a rich game full of combat and teamwork, play alone or play with your friends its always fun. plus if you have left 4 dead or left 4 dead 2 your can drop by Mercy Hospital for a fast paced chaotic one of a kind robbery. Its Fun For The Whole Family!P.S(Last part not true)\n",
      "Only games are zombies, no pvp gun fights, still fun if you get a server of friends\n",
      "I was waiting ages for this game, and I was not dissapointed. A few things were a bit of a let down. For example, you claim to be a \"vigilante\" but really you are just a criminal that occasionally does something good. The hacking itself is pretty basic, but plays with some interesting ideas. You really do feel like you have power over the city and it makes the game really enjoyable. The combat system is really simple and a bit annoying, but it does what it needs to do well. The game looks ok, but I have to run it on high/medium settings, so it's more my fault than the game's. There is a LOT to do that will keep you entertained, but sometimes the side quests that pop up on the screen can get a bit annoying. The multiplayer is good but a little lacking. I would have loved to see a open world multiplayer where you can do whatever you want with your friends in this amazingly open world. Overall a really good game, one of my favourites already. I can see myself playing it for a long time. As for a rating, well maybe around an 8/10 for me. I was really looking forward to being a bringer of justice, but I was let down as it feels like another GTA with a bit of crime stopping.\n",
      "Me having 500+ hours of Rust must mean that I have a good understanding of this game right. Well I do and this is one of the most fun and intense survival games you will come across no other survival game will give you gameplay like rust this is a unique game that you can either play by yourself or with a group of friends the game never get repetitive and there is always something to do. The dev team behind it is great bringing a new update every friday and talks to the community to see what would make the game better and what makes the game not so great via reddit also the devs listin to the community and to take things that people say into mid. In my opinion I would recomend this game to everyone wether you only play it on an occasion or become fully emersed in the gameplay. 10/10\n",
      "After several years of my friends begging me to buy the game, many Gmod videos added to my favorites and many looks at the workshop, I finally got it. And you know what? Money well spent.Saying why this game rules is like saying why steam itself is an incredible game platform.There's not much of a story...at all. You just spawn in items and characters and do whatever the hell you want with it. And that's why this game is so cool. It's just you and your imagination where the sky is the limit. You can race a go-kart on a ferry with a Bioshock Big Daddy underwater with a Diamond Sword. If that's not a selling point for you guys, then I don't know what is.\n",
      "Really fun game if you play with friends and a lot of extra maps from workshop!\n",
      "This game is horrible and full of cheats.Every server I went to there were players flying in mid-air, hovering around in mid-air and one shot killing me and other players. Even with both Anti-cheats systems in place, lots of people still hack in this game, which makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable.A typical run in Rust begins with you running for 2 minutes, then being head shotted or instantly killed by a fellow player. This is what happens 90% per cent of the time to players who don't hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth. The community in this game is a joke (more like a community of trolls and angry children), which most people just kill you for the hell of it. There is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers/ hacker groups, which you don't stand a chance. To sum this game up, is to say that it is a run and get gunned down simulator, unless of cause you use hacks.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP GAME! It will be 20 dollars down the drain.\n",
      "So i brought this game because it did looked like a nice space sim, and I have always wanted to play another space sim, but have not found any recient space sims appealing. The first 60 hours of the game were great, the spaces ships felt great, the atmosphere was great. The after a few days of getting into the game everything when downhill. The space ships were expensive, the replacement cost was getting higher and higher, the missions at the stations were still only offering 10k per job, and all of this became not only became a huge grind for credits (in-game money) but it really wasnt even worth doing as I was being constantly kill by players in pythons and anaconda space ships (the best ships in the game.)To sum things up is that I got really bored of this game very quick, as all it really seems to be is 400 something star systems with with same 4 types of space stations, and 20 of the same space craft.Pros+Nice hud.+Nice space station design. +Nice sound of thrusters.+Nice space ship design.Cons-Repeative gameplay.-lack of Space station design.-lack of Space ship design.  -Expensive ship replacment (if player is destroyed)-Lack of jobs-Lack of credits paid for jobs.-Unbalanced ships.-Is not new player friendly-Paying for different paint job with real money.-Players in high tech ships such as the python and anaconda destroying you, just to troll you.This game felt like it had great potential, but is nothing more then a copy and paste game, which features the same solar systems with the same 4 types of space stations everywhere in the game.\n",

      "This game is super fun, I played it with two guys in the same clan as me and it's really enjoyable. It's a very original idea and it can be really challenging. It has very simple graphics but in later bombs alarms will go off and the lights will flicker just making it harder. If you want to see some gameplay go and check out this video https://youtu.be/EzXc_C0jKNMI would give this game a 9/10 it's great with friends and even just being the dude reading is super fun and challenging.\n",

      "Here is an accurate tutorial on how to play. Play for a few hours and begin to get bored. Suddenly a new weapon appears! Use it because you think its the best weapon ever. Start to get bored again. Suddenly a hat appears! Wear this hat as everyone calls you names like \"gibus\" and \"noob\" (they just jealous of your amazing hat). Suddenly 100 hours of gameplay! Watch as you become a friendless hermit who scrap banks 24/7. Suddenly 100+ hours of \"gameplay\"! Watch as the game went from playing it to gaining hats and stranges and watch how your social life slowly dies. 11/10 pretty hats.\n",

      "Portal 2 is an experience that must be played to truely understand what it is. Is it a shooter, or a puzzle game? The answer is both. Portal was one of the games that defined this generation of gaming, among other Valve creations, raising the bar for the quality of the sequel. I am happy to report that it does not dissapoint. With 3 new charactors (Wheatley, Cave Johnson and Caroline), Portal 2 delivers a plot that is perfect in nearly every way, adding to the original, but not taking away. Alongside the many charactor developments and plot twists that I will not mention (you have to see for yourself!), gameplay is beautiful. The added mechanics make for more interesting puzzles than in the first game and many more of said puzzles. The Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or the portal gun, is back and better than ever. You get the portal gun towards the start of the game and keep it until the end. You will encounter many new challenges that you must solve, up until the end. The end of the game is something that should not be spoiled, but I will tell you that it does not dissappoint.After the single-player experience, the game keeps going into the new co-op mode. Playing as one of two bots with your friend controlling the other makes for an interesting experience. Yes, this means there are two portal guns, and yes this means that there are four portals. These puzzles are challenging depending on how well you do. If you sit in the corner not contributing, you will not get through the first puzzle in the co-op campaign. There are many moments in co-op where you just feel like having fun and playing tricks on your partner, which the game lets you do. It is obvious that this game will put your friendship to the test. With voice chat and your \"ping tool,\" you have ease of communication, so you can't blame the game for that. These tools are quite fun and easy to use, so there is no learning curve.To summerize, Portal 2 is definately worth the $20 it costs and even more worth it when it goes on sale. I've replayed the single-player many, many times and enjoyed the game all the way through my play time of 100+ hours. Portal 2 gets a 10/10.\n",
      "I love Tiger Woods Unite. I get to be paid to play golf, then spend it on expensive luxuries in my beach-side condo. 10/10Seriously, though, Tower Unite is a fantastic game. It's buggy, it is somewhat unfinished, but the current state of the game is incredible considering that it is still in an Early Access alpha. The developers are incredibly dedicated. They don't seem to be like any other, as they are open and transparent, making the game experience that much easier. The developers answer questions on their Discord, and seem to update the game frequently to fix bugs and add new features and gameplay tweaks. And the game itself, is very fun. Several friends got the game with me, and we've had so much fun with the minigames. Whether we're playing Minigolf, Virus, Ball Race, Planet Panic, chilling in the amazingly customizable condos, watching dank memes in the theater, or listening to Mac's beautiful voice in the tutorial series, Tower Unite is worth every penny of the asking price.\n",
      "quick good game fun to play with friends and well executed. great game!\n",
      "Boderlands 2 is a great game to have a fun and high octane shooter with your friends or even man it yourself. THe game has a great sense of progress as you continue on your journey to stop Handsome Jack you cmoe across a wide range of enemies. Every gamer who plys this game will have that sense of power as they come from klling weak enemies to taking on bosses and badasses. THis a great gme for anybody who wants a shooter with tons of loot and a seemingly endless amount of content. This game is a must have.\n",
      "I think no more room in hell is a brilliant game.it's a co-op fist person zombie survival shoot em up game with different maps and challanges.the feel of the game is great with the zombie horde pounding on the doors and fires burning in the buildings and a complete lack of electicity, and not to mention the moaning of the zombies, giving the game an overall creepy atmosphere.The interface is rather like that of hl2 but the weapon choosing panel differs from the original game making it much more user friendly.Over all a great mod for hl2 and i deffinately recommend it to other gamers.\n",
      "As much as I only have 20 hours on this game, There isnt much to talk about. The game is addicting as ♥♥♥♥ and can ruin your life if you dont control it. Its the same game over and over again. Two sides, the same map, same defences and ancients. The sounds, graphics, and game play is just awsome. However, I do find the community to suck alot. I do not have a problem with the Russians but my problem is most of the people who do speak English are the most whiny ♥♥♥ people and report if you dont do as they say. Then theres the unfair system of the penalty pool. The fact that one can get reported with no evidence and suffer longer waiting times and ♥♥♥♥♥ier ♥♥♥♥. In conclusion, I recomend people to play this game with a group of friends, maybe time to time random servers but be careful that this game wont ruin your life.\n",
      "Everyone giving this game bad reviews because of airdrops or Sony getting acquired by an investment firm are kinda silly. I paid $20 for this game, and I've played 90 hours so far and plan to play many more. First off - to anyone who says airdrops are pay to win, you are completely wrong. Your chances of getting a gun from a paid airdrop are almost as slim as your chances are surviving with the loot that actually drops from the crate - I managed to single handedly steal an airdrop from 3 guys because they weren't even watching, but I didn't get a gun anyway, only IEDs, moonshine and some swizzle. Another airdrop I saw only dropped things like a waist pouch and wooden tools. So if you do manage to get a SINGLE gun from an airdrop, you will have to be 1) extremely lucky to actually get an airdrop containing a gun 2) extremely lucky to actually get the airdrop and survive the zombies and attacking players3) extremely lucky to survive more than an hour with the single gun you got from a crate - WHICH IS AN ITEM YOU CAN FIND IN THE WORLD ANYWAYDOESN'T SOUND TOO PAY TO WIN TO ME, BUT ANYWAY.Okay, so now you should be fairly convinced that airdrops are not gamebreaking. This game, is fun as hell. I had nobody to buy this game with and have made many friends (and enemies) by just running around and talking to the whacky people found all around the lovely H1Z1 map. Most people will stop for a chat (unless you have a gun and they also have a gun, then they will probably shoot you) and you can always have a good time within a few minutes of spawning on a high population server.I have no idea where I was going with this review, but this game is fun. Really, really, really, ridiculously fun. I love shooting people in the head with an arrow. I love getting shot in the head with an arrow. I love blasting nerds away with a shotgun. I love getting blasted away by nerds with a shotgun. I love the zombies. The zombies hate me. I hate the bears. The bears, also, hate me.Who cares what this game turns into? It's a great way to spend $20 and it's fun NOW. The changes they have been making have only been good, and anyone who thinks this game will turn into a horrible monstrosity of a videogame out of nowhere are probably the same people that think Obama is in the Illuminati and will shoot into space in a super secret alien aircraft if the world goes downhill.Anyway, buy this game and we can have fun together. I might even shoot you in the face with an arrow. \n",
      "\"It looks lame, but it is the most fun I've had in a video game in about 5 years.\" Those were the words uttered to me by a friend. At first, I was skeptical.But after cleaning all the ♥♥♥♥ off my desk, computer and surroundings, I can tell you - he wasn't lying.\n",
      "Great game with awesome graphics. I like this game because it allows you to free roam around Paradise City to get you to the start point of a race, there are also heaps of crazy jumps to be found around the city. Burnout Paradise also has the option to go free roam ONLINE with all of your friends! Great game.\n",
      "Excellent game recommended for people who like MOBA (Massively Online Battle Arena) games it involves teamwork as well as skill inorder to play this game and although it takes quite some time to master and learn the basics of the game, but once you get the hang of it, it really is something interesting. Although the community is a little toxic and harsh however, once you get to the higher levels or you play with friends it will definately be an enjoyable experience. Overall i rate this game a game worth trying as it is really a gem in itself and be it old or new players there is always something new to learn :) . \n",
      "Like Swords? Like Bows? Like sandwiches? Like LOTS of wepons? Like lots of chacters to unlock? Got battle block thether?If you do you get cool stuff.

I really like the game and recomend it to anyone that likes a co-op, adventure, knight/creature game.\n",

      "I've had cobalt since mojang first mentioned it. It has came a long way since then keeping everything that made the game great. It's something I'd love to play more often, however, it's definately a social game in my opinion. Not having any friends who have this game makes playing it quite hard unfortinately. It may say I have a small amount of time played, but that's because I just got the code for steam. I've had it downloaded for years now, and it has seased to amaze me!\n",
      "I may be an idiot, but this game makes it very difficult to know what to do next. I've spent at least 10 minutes one time trying to work out how to get past a fence. It's great if you like the Avengers series, but I think it needs to be more user-friendly.\n",
      "This game is great to play with friends, but I personally found was difficult to stay engaged with in single player. Either way it's still a solid game though. Great value when it's on special!\n",
      "holy crap this is the most fun ♥♥♥♥ i have ever played if you dont have this then we are not friends\n",

Currently it has been in beta for a while since I'm sure Splash Damage wants to make this game perfect before calling it a full game (since we have more mercs on the way :) ) Pros:-Diverse Mercs (That means race and gender too)-Large maps that coerce you to have teamwork to the fullest-Fairly well-designed maps with secondary objectives to keep both sides on their toes-Proxy, because she's Proxy :3Cons:-Currently unbalanced games are fairly widespread, though improvements have been made and are continuing to be made-Best played with friends, since bad communication=bad dayI really hope to see what else this game can offer.

      "Definitely recommended this game!  It feels like robbing a bank (not legally cuz it's a game) with your trusted best friends (or strangers) I'll give 7 outta 10  :3\n",
      "An interesting game for both casual and hardcore gamers, inducing the strategic side of your brain. Civilisation V is the type of game that one plays when they have a few hours to spare, each session lasting between 5-10 hours, sometimes even 20. Although this may seem quite daunting to those who haven't experienced the joy of defeating barbarians that have ravaged your land and taken your workers for over 1000 years, the game is captivating enough to make time fly, literally ingame and out, as in 1 turn is 100 years, get it... Bad jokes aside, the game is designed brilliantly, containing beautiful graphics, allowing players to view the board in a 3d or strategic way. When you first load up the screen and you see buttons and words on all 4 sides of the display, don't be discouraged by this, I will admit that for a board game, it has far more mechanics then one would normally expect, including things such as technology trees, policies, productions, settling, etc. the list could go on forever! But these rules and ideas can be picked up pretty quickly, seeing as how you will be playing it for many hours, and this allows for another aspect of the game, Discovery. You will find that initially the map will seem quite small, sometimes even wondering 'How are we gonna spead out and conquer the world with this minute amount of land'. But as you start building troops and scouts and boats, you quickly realize how small your city is compared to the land that awaits you, granted the map size and pace of the game can all be changed in the game settings. The multiplayer mode can also be one of the most ridiculous (in a good way) way of finding out the true nature of your friends, whether it be through them starting a war with you, forming an alliance, plotting with you to backstack some other poor friend that you both think might win the game. The multiplayer mode, I have found, becomes a better tutorial than the tutorial that the game has to offer, allowing you to learn faster with a person that know the rules and can interact with you as opposed to the AI that pops up messages every so often that tells you the obvious. Caution: If you're playing this at night with some friends over voice chat, remember to close your door as you will find yourself shouting and yelling. Why? well you'll have to play to find out...Overall, this game will not disappoint you, introducing new mechanics and ideas every step of the way, straining and developing your brain as you panic over losing money and resources, essentially plonking you in a position of a world leader and seeing how far you can make your civilastion survive. I recommend this game to everyone of all ages, if they're looking for a relaxed way to spend their day, but if your looking for fast action, FPS, bloodsplattery goodness, you might want to try something else.\n",

Meeting a new player is actually scary, Hes naked and might have a hatchet or rock and hes running at you.People are very harsh in this game, Especially the Chinese people me and my friend found. They are horrible they're not nice at all. We were walking past and they said something in Chinese then said \"You are mudahfahker\" and killed us. We did not do anything to them, Then we found their base and at that point another friend xKoriat joined and helped us.

And yeah they stuffed up the name of something: \"Devils Share\" like they share things between devils, like they are caring devils, instead of \"Devil's Share\". Its just the worst, an abomination.

This is a extremely fun game to play with your friends, it allows you to be creative and to troll your friends with that creativity. Garry's mod is a limitless game, it allows you to do stuff even minecraft can't do! Although there are those people online who take some stuff too seriously unlike TF2 (Check it out), that is why it is better to play with your friends but playing online with other people is not so bad\n",
      "This game is unique. It is like bringing a MMORPG to a FPS game and it is amazing!! The way valve design this game is brilliant, every class and weapon has it's own strength and weaknesses. Plus adding things such as taunts and hats makes it more fun and hilarious. But the most amazing thing about TF2 is that you can be an idiot or a fool and no one will get mad!! Even sometimes people will be a idiot with you! It is a game nothing like COC or Rift, It is a legit fun game where you can laugh your ♥♥♥ off and never get bored especially with friends. I highly recommend it!!\n",
      "Ace of Spades. Before Jagex was on the scene, this game had potential. I was an early Alpha tester and I must say, the game was good. In Beta it was even better. When it was first released on Steam, I played it non-stop for 6 hours. Then I played in short bursts with friends. Then, after I hadn't been on for about 2 months, everything had changed. Apparently Jagex decided the game wasn't traffic, or at least that's what it came across as. So they tried to make it better. But they made it a despicable game. Ace of Spades is no longer worth its non sale price of $15. It's not even worth $2. I just wish Jagex would listen to the desperate people who used to play AoS to restore it to what it used to be. It's just not worth it anymore.2/10\n",
      "It's about time I reviewed this game. Europa Universalis IV is simply amazing. I pour a lot of my extra time into this game, and are never disappointed with the game. The newest update to EUIV added a lot of new features for free, something that is rare in this age of gaming. Developer Support: Simply the best I've seen in years. Paradox are one of the few companies that don't milk their customers for money, and actually listen and respond to the community. EUIV is updated regularly and every now and then a massive update comes out. Even though this game has an incessant amount of DLC, don't allow that to throw you off. Unlike the Civilization franchise of late, you need NO DLC to enjoy this game. Much of the DLC is for a more in depth experience and reminds me of a crowdfunding system. Graphics: The graphics of EUIV aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but they fit the game and it's genre. Most of the graphical elements within EUIV is the map itself, and there is decent detail for this. Military units (Naval and Army) are rather generic and bland, and this is where the main clump of DLC comes in. Most of the DLC are visual enhancements to the game, adding varied unit appearances. In terms of the GUI, I personally love it. The GUI without any menus up is rather spartan, but provides all nescessary information to the player. With menus, however, is where EUIV shines. The menus are complex and indepth, easy to navigate and sometimes a bit unclear. Difficulty: I'll say it now,  if you have no patience you are probably not going to like EUIV. The game has a steep learning curve in comparison to most strategy games, and that can be accredited to the game sitting by itself in it's own subdivison on strategy. It is neither and RTS or TB, but rather an RTS that is pauseable (ruining the entire purpose of an RTS). To new players, menus can be confusing and war may be a major attractor to new players. Personally, I say learn the menus first then unpause the game. Gameplay: Gameplay in EUIV can be boring if you let it be. Most of the time, the game attempts to keep you involved with events and issues around your country. I've had a friend turn away from this game due to them not bothering to learn the menus and hopping right in as Sweden. Then, he immediately declared war on his overlord. Not pretty. War is painful in this game to conduct properly,  and to be honest, it is extremely hard to play as a non-european civilisation once the colonial countries come. All in all, EUIV is worth every dollar. With an excellent developer who supports their game and listens to the community, and an invloving behemoth of a game, it is truly worth the $40 I payed.\n",
      "So to start this game you pick a destination to begin you're journey.There are six location's such as spain,london and some other really nice tropical places I forgot there names xD. I picked London because it looked like a ♥♥♥♥ hole compared to the others and I want the feeling of looking foward to going to a nice bohama island in the future of playing this game. When i started playing this game around say 50 minutes ago I had no clue what to do and still very much the same but that will soon vanish. The gameplay to this is very complex, reminds me far to much of everquest gameplay. Every little tiny bit of content just seems to carry more content and complexity and I love that! It feels like you achieve somthing everytime you complete a new task or a new skill!There is no auction house :'( which is the only dissapointment I have atm, but as suffisicated as this game is they make you the auction house! You must bargain with other player, sell your good's and make an absolute fortune or even make your self titled as king merchent.The graphics are nice :) The content is insane! I have been told there are easily over 500 ships in this game and each one can be designed by you! With over 1000 decoration pieces it seems rare to spot a twin of you're ship :'). I allways spot people wearing different clothing and different weapons. Its rare to spot someone looking the same as someone else. Unless of coure you are a noob liek me and are still wearing you're student uniform :p.The world map is our world map. The uncharted waters page on steam simply states there are over 180 locations to be explored including the entire ocean. Last of all the community! I have not been in a kinder comunity ever! as soon as i hopped on world chat I was warned about certain people camping at certain spots waiting to kill other people. But hey I was told by a group of people that they would protect me! and help me out if i ever get attacked and one of my new friends said if i ever want a player killed that i should tell him ;). Soi yes in under an hour I have now made two new friends :S. I was also offered one million dollars from each player I was talking to in the world chat <3.I cant wait to explore and venture forth through out this game even more! So far I absolutely love it!10/10Great gameplay, Awesome amount of content!\n",

      "First things frist. I really want to recommend dead by daylight to everyone, it is great game to play, but at this time a cannot for some reasons.1) Lobby simulator 2016. if you want the get your surivior perks, you must play in a lobby, this leave you eather getting into a lobby where everyone will bail so they can find there friends or you're the one doing it. i know they where trying to give you the spooky feeling of playing with random people to make it scary, but sometimes you just want people you can trust to play with. Just make a group with friends please.2) Call of duty would be proud. If you want to keep your rank as a survivor, NEVER,AND I MEAN NEVER GET HOOKED. Once you are placed on it, get ready to say bye to that rank point cause your about to have a sleep over with the killer, he will just sit at your feet till you're dead or some random thinks that the killer is afk and trys to save you, getting knocked out cold.3) Now watch me rank, now watch me de-rank. Now this part of my rant personaly makes me rage. The ranking system. Simple, if you want to rank, you need three things. A buddy, good internet connnection and luck, cause if you don't, you're in for a ride. to get your rank up, you must survive or kill. But your rank will go down if you die or not kill people, leave a game, D.C from a game (even if the killer has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet), if the killer or all survivor leave before the end of a game, hell even turning on four out of five generators on and escaping will (yes that did happen), and completing all the task at hand while your team mate sit in the bushes that end up getting you killed while they get escape because they don't care to help you or the camper killer is setting up for the night.This is only a few thing i don't like, but don't take my word on it. Experience the good annd the bad for yourself.If the team wants to make this game the best experience, please just let there be a friends lobby, the other stuff i can live with.Thank you for your time\n",
      "Call of Duty is one of the many games (FPS related) that I play, you cant exactly contrast the game with other FPS games are they have different play styles. Most of the time, Call of Duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on. Well thats what it seems like to me.The game is good, dont get me wrong, it is enjoyable to play BUT there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button.1- What the game has become.The days of being able to use other weapons in game is over, being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an LMG or Sniper is no longer a play style that can be used. there was nothing that I loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on DOM. instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style.2- Rush.I can understand that Call of Duty is a fast FPS game, one of the easiest to play in that matter, you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like Battlefield, you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots, Sniper Ghost Warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it. both Black ops 2, Ghost and AW (I dont own AW but from friends that have the game) are saturated with the use of SMGs and/or Shotguns, having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a Sniper almost obselete, LMG users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high DMG smgs you find in BO3, yet when it comes to balancing things....3- How to guide: Balancing Weapons.after using the Haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that I do not understand   -Somehow, it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage, yet, fires a buckshot, like most of the shotguns in BO3   -I am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon, note most of the people that are hating on me, get to close.You See, Treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between Balance and butthurt, Balance, is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol, that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the Haymaker, the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone, simple as that. but when balancing weapons, also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from. This could be from places like reddit, youtube etc, once you read these comments, actually take some time to look at statistics, I am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right. there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing SMGs with have the range of a sniper... Im not just saying this because I get killed byt SMGs quite a lot, but more so that it is true. for example, if you look at say the Vesper, chuck rapid fire, laser sight and fast mag. You pretty much has a lightweight minigun.there are positives to the game, the zombies is spot on, I love it!, have enjoyed every single moment of it!, especially when you disconnect from Singleplayer....Multiplayer, although has a fair amount of issues, is fun.but my main complaint for the game, is the constant FPS spikes/stutters... any kind of help I look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer... I have updated the drivers, which had pretty much no effect what-so-ever, getting a better computer well, I think I have good enough specks to be honest (i7-2600, HD7950 and 8GB ram).Dont you find it sad how, supposedly, Creating a sequal to what was quite a good game (Black ops 2) take such a downfall, games are meant for enjoyment, being able to communicate with friends, and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother. Dont you feel dissapointed in YOUR inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer. Isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50% of the comments/reviews on the game are Negative? I know this will most likely not been seen by the eyes of any Treyarch developer but all these questions run through my mind. the thing is... what goes through yours...\n",
      "When I played this game, I felt at peace; the main character is like a meek doe, exploring the environment and this instills some sort of tranquility in me. Life Is Strange puts the player in the main character's place in a similar way that some of Quantic Dream's games do, but it does this more humbly; you won't be rushed into making life-changing decisions that you can't rewind (because, of course, you can rewind). The game throws quite a few tough decisions at you, but it gives you all the time you want to decide which one you want to choose. In this manner, the game makes you feel like more of an experimenting onlooker than actually being in the game. The premise is pretty ridiculous (how to entropy??), but that's not the point. Like those \"would you rather...\" questions (and movies like Groundhog Day), it makes you ponder and imagine, while also giving you the thrill of seeing the outcomes of your hypothetical/real decisions. The story can be a bit predictable at times (even before you go back in time) and a few characters are very stereotypical, but nonetheless, it is a good story with fairly good character development. It explores many themes quite well, including love, friendship, depression, and self-exploration.Playing Life Is Strange is like looking through a camera: you're there, but not really part of the action when you hold the camera. You have to decide which moment you want to capture. Once you've decided, you take the shot and that moment is recorded, and you wonder how well it will turn out. You can look back at that picture later and notice its imperfections and perfections, but whether you see beauty in it or not; in a strange way, you'll feel glad that you took the shot.I recommend you take the shot.\n",
      " Team Fortress 2 is forever-evolving, has cartoony art, fun, thrilling gameplay, interesting characters and a creative, friendly community keeping it alive. Use teamwork, strategy, fast thinking and reflexes or just interact with people in fun and sometimes hilarious ways. You can have a lot of fun playing with friends in this game. ... Unfortrunately, Valve has ruined their own game and UI by removing Valve servers from the server browser and making an ill-titled \"Casual\" game mode with several other changes that essentially seem like a sad attempt to copy 'Overwatch'.\n",
      "Not fun and frustrating learning curve. Very easy to die which is acceptable due to the premise of the game, but advancement is very difficult and not intuitive. You might find some fun in it if you have a large number of friends playing and learning at the same time, but otherwise it's not worth it.\n",

      "Long story short: A run-of-the-mill modern military shooter with a meaningless and short single-player campaign. While neat with graphics and sound, the $15 seems a bit too much on a rather easy and generic 6 hour game. Pass it unless you're very interested.DISCLAIMER: While I haven't played the sequel yet, Metro Last Light, I've heard a lot of the narrative is improved upon with that game. I have also not played the Redux versions as of yet.Metro 2033 is a first person shooter that takes place in the tunnels of Moscow in the somewhat distant future. You play as Artyom, a dude who is trying to get to the other side of the Subway to save his hometown from mutants. On the way, you encounter bandits, creatures, and a strange supernatural entity.While the goal of the single-player is made clear from the start, it quickly loses track as you meet up with other characters, and basically go through escort-like areas with them. It's hard to keep focused when you're constantly meeting different people and experience different kinds of gameplay. For example, one moment you're fending off a minecart from mutants. The next, you're sneaking through a bandit hideout, stealthily killing each person you find. The next, you're walking down a corridor talking to a guy with very little coming at you. Each with some different NPC leading you. The whole journey feels disjointed and inconsistent.Throughout the game, you acquire a bunch of weapons. Most of these function a bit differently, but some just seem outright pointless, like the ball bearing shooter, which can barely even damage enemies, runs out of ammo quickly, and occupies the same slot as the shotguns. My biggest issue with the weapons is that there's very little variety. There's nothing past pistols, assault rifles, and shotguns.These weapons can be found on the ground, alongside medkits (which quickly restore your health) and gasmasks (which basically are a time meter for above ground sections). My issue with the medkits is that the game is a cover-based shooter where all of your health eventually regenerates. In gunfights with other humans, medkits are only there to save time rather than hiding behind cover. In fights with mutants, medkits are pointless, as the regenerating health mechanic pretty much saves you from any hits that the mutants do, provided you dodge their attacks a bit. All of these items are also sold in shop areas which appear in the first half of the game (they oddly never appear again after chapter 4 I believe). An interesting concept here is that bullets are the currency of the game. My issue with this is that the kind of bullets that are used as currency are also the weakest bullets, which removes the whole purpose of them.So the gameplay has you going through a bunch of different locations, meeting a few different kinds of enemies. You'll fight humans, who all hitscan you if you move out of cover. The gameplay for these guys is pretty generic and bland. While their AI is good in moving into cover and such, there's just no variety between them throughout the game. The other kinds of enemies are the mutants. There's a few different kinds, but they all can only melee attack you, making \"running backwards in circles and firing wildly\" an unfortunately effective method. These enemies also deal a surprisingly low amount of damage, even on harder difficulties, making them very easy and nonthreatening targets, which is a shame, as they're supposedly the huge threat of the story.There's also a few stealth sections in the game. Artyom's watch has a coloured light section that indicates how well seen you are, but, at least for me, it doesn't work all that well. There's been times where I've hit the red light, and have still been able to run through unnoticed. Other times, the light is green, and I start getting shot at. Stealth is a very weak element of the game, and fortunately (or unfortunately) it only comes up three times in the game.Of course, there's a lot of on-rails sections where you're on some sort of moving vehicle and you're shooting at stuff. These vary the story up a bit, but in general are a bit easier than the rest of the game and lack the depth or challenge that you'd be expecting during these usually explosive sequences.I don't know if it's just me, but I experienced a lot of bugs with the game. There's the above stealth system which sometimes doesn't indicate the right thing. I've had AI glitch up and run into walls constantly. I've had times where a scripted sequence at the beginning of the game ended to my death. I've had times where the UI would not come up. The worst one I had though was that my gas mask would not come off my face, which was okay at first. However, with the gas mask, taking damage starts to crack the visor, making it extremely difficult to see, and since I couldn't take it off, I was forced to play through literally half the game with my screen almost obscured (loading a save or checkpoint wouldn't fix it).Graphically the game looks alright: depth of field and fancy lighting and particle effects makes the tunnels and overground look starkly different. The sound is also done alright: the music builds up at the right times (although it's pretty generic), and the sound design works well as sounds echo in the tunnels and fade off in the overground sections.Unfortunately, the engine cannot make up for the game's shortcomings. Metro 2033 was not that enjoyable for me. I played through the game twice: once on hard, and once on Ranger hard (which hides the UI and makes everything (including you) die very quickly). Both playthroughs were plagued with issues for me. I didn't enjoy the game that much mainly because it was short and didn't offer anything substantial in terms of gameplay.And that's a shame because my friends tell me there's a great story tucked away underneath it all. It's just I was too focused on the gameplay to really experience that. There's a couple of side things to collect, and there's a second ending that isn't purely a decision at the end of the game. But, especially the ending, I felt that the game was giving me mixed messages about who was the good guy in the story, which would be fine if it was a bit more clear-cut what the implications of my decisions were.Metro 2033 is a modern military shooter first and foremost. If you like those kinds of games, you may find something good here. The setting is unique, and ultimately you might have a good time with it. However, if you, like me, don't like those kinds of games, pass on Metro 2033, as it won't do anything that amazing to interest you.RATING: 0 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do[/table]\n",

I don't care if the community is 'mean' I've learnt and stuck with insurgency for the longest time, even played a bit of arma so was excited for the Mil Sim experience. My experience might differ from others but this was mine, on the Australian server feel free to troll and downvote I couldn't care less it's the internet it happens everywhere I won't lose sleep lolAt current I can't recommend this game (as cool as the guns and classes felt), I uninstalled & asked for a refund, however I am willing to revist on release through other friends that decide to purchase from Aus and make a decision if I will purchase then, who knows by then there may be more Aus servers to play on and they might have a more team based community.\n",
      "Edit 12/04/2015 never recieved a ticket, terrible customer service though the networking issues are fixed while I will play it I can not publicy support a game with service the equivilant of the screw up that was archeage.Edit 13/01/2015 Still no response from ticket, at this time I do not recommend this game especially if they cant even acknowledge recieving it and the fact that I my hard work on every server is inaccessible so quickly, uploaded my output file for the errors and my dxdiag for my system specs to help them.*ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW*I don't normally buy early access games because of disasterous outcomes but this I think is an exception, this review was written during alpha 10.4 (scrow down to bottom paragraph if you want it straight to the point).While it has its bugs, I've seen games alot worse at full release, this game has great promise, fingers crossed the finished product reflects not just my expectations but most other 7 Days to Die players.Bugs that stand out: At this time there is a condtradicting issue with EAC (easy anti cheat) and Steam, if one cuts out you get booted from the server after getting a message about unable to find EAC being used, sometimes you get banned for it which makes it impossible to rejoin and get back to the action and have to start all over again on another server, your best option would be to either rent a server or start a private server and/or use hamachi or other vpn to play with your friends (you may need to open your ports).Another bug possibly related to the first just plain tells you the connection failed after a few trys it can sometimes work.The third bug which I run into often on a server i've been on in awhile is one that causes me after being in the server for about a minute it just crashes to the game menu without an error message, so I had to constantly change servers (This still happened on my friends rented server, I'm currently awaiting a reply from a ticket I put in a few days ago).One game mechanic bug sometimes even when your inventory is open but your toolbelt is full splitting a stack out of the camp fire can delete all of the item in question except for one.**All in all though I quite enjoy the game, once this easy cheat stuff has been resolved and the networking issues etc I think I'll be more addicted than now, At this time I do recommend it but only if you are going to either play single player or lan with your mates in house or over vpn.\n",

      "OK let me start by saying that this is a great game. BUT... at the moment i find there are a few core problems such as rediculous op wraith, moderate level of glitches and bugs such as freezing or getting stuck while climbing through windows or hiding in corners, as well as other relatively minor tweaks. because of most of this, the game becomes extremely frustrating, and it does not suprise me everyone leaves when they know theres a wraith... That DUCKING WRAITH! this game would make a great coop with friends IF THERE WAS A WAY TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!!! NO JOINING FRIENDS MATCHES EXCEPT ON A TOTALLY PRIVATE SERVER HOST. Also having no way to communicate with the other survivors in game makes this even more frustrating. so summary, at this time i would hold off for a few months until they really start bringing on the updates (Which is practically grunteed) and fix some of these core issues because at the moment you either have great matches or terrible ones (basically terrible if theres a wraith or if Somebody is doggy guarding all the time)\n",

      "Payday is a very nice game and all but the gunplay lacks in the way of sensitivity and user friendlyness, when I was a lower level I could not aim the carbine unless the guy was directly infront of me so I went with the pistol because it waqs accurate and easy to use compared to the terrible iron sites. The AI are decent but at times they can pull some fancy tricks to catch you with your pants down (in normal difficulty). Unfortunantly, to my annoyance, there are only a couple of levels that allow for stealth approaches (whats the point of surpressed weapons), and that the stealth sections were badly made, splutter splutter diamond hiest, and the friedly ai dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about stealth.I found that the game is great if you liked L4D2 and like L4D2 it is largely based on teamwork but it is the best to play if you have a crew with all your mates in it. Dont freak if you dont have a mic and most of all get a bunch of mates and do OVERDRILL, it the best way to level up. 9/10\n",

      "I think that with the learning part of the game, they should add a whole section dedicated to learning some manners and some resilience. Game is fun, but randoms aren't fun to play with. Get a group of friends go into a match and pray you don't get somebody who is abusive for little to no reason. It says I recommend, but my opinion is entirely 50/50. There is a TL:DR down below, I'm just going to have a rantThis game has it highs and a lot of lows. The first game of the day you play might be pretty good. You might get on a team that is rather friendly and you have a good match, you play well, everyone says GG and you leave feeling like you really accomplished something no matter if you win or lose. That is the game trying to lull you in a sense of trust and happiness when it decides to throw a massive hardball of a game that'll leave you with more stress than if you ran a marathon while carting a wheel barrow. After that you might do a few things. 1: Retaliate. They might have the right to get SLIGHTLY annoyed, but clearly their reaction is like they have a wasp trapped inside their room and they are freaking out. They're opinion honestly doesn't matter and sometimes even trying to talk to them in a calm matter is utterly futile. I would not reacting and ignore what they say, because all you're doing is adding to your stress. Also when you react, they usually start to feel justified in their actions and start to pile it on. When you react we all lose. Think of those people as Nukes, because once they are set off we are all going down. Mutually Asssured Depression2: Try to redeem yourself in the next game you'll play. It is highly recommended you avoid doing this at all costs. You might want to prove it to yourself, that you can play good. Don't. Clear your head, relax and find something else to pass the time, until you find yourself in a calm mood. Heck, I'm doing it as I write this because I might be the guy who starts yelling at somebody who doesn't deserve it. Instead I'm issuing a warning to all the people who are unfamiliar with MOBA's and want to try them. This goes for all online games actually. Single player games don't yell at you for making 1 mistake. Except Animal Crossing, Mr.Resetti will give a mean scolding if you turn of your game without saving.This is a perfect summary of the experiences I have had playing this fun game with a rather toxic community. Espicially the people who are immediately racist to anybody that speaks another language. Some people should just change their name to Klu Klux Ken or something.TL:DRGame's fun, people suck, I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too (I just happen to not be vocal about it) and play undertale or something. Play TUG, have a tug; anything to avoid the toxic Dota community and stay happy I guess.\n",

      "Planetside 2 is a Sci-fi MMO shooter with three factions fighting over a planet's resources and territory with many classes of military such as light assault, heavy assault, medic ect. if you have friends (the more the merrier) to play with you can create a squad and work together as a team. But overall it is fun if you comit a good amount of time and have a good squad you can have the best organised chaos in a MMO game, i would defenatly recomend Planetside 2 (it's free)\n",
      "PlanetSide 2 is far more polished than it has any right to be. The game contains three (soon to be four) vast battlefields, each capable of holding hundreds (if not thousands) of individual players, allowing infantry and vehicular warfare on a colossal scale.Described by many as Battlefield + Halo, this comparison is quite accurate, but PlanetSide 2 manages to dwarf both games in terms of scale and sheer ambition.Each of the six character classes and eight vehicles (five land, three air) each have their own large upgrade trees to complete, though the game encourages you to adopt a certain role over another, instead of being the jack of all trades. There are also a huge amount of weapons to collect, with no gun unfairly balanced. These weapons may be purchased with real money, but they may also be unlocked by simply playing the game.However, judging by my personal experience, leveling up seems quite slow (I have over 200 hours spent in-game, but I'm not even level 30 yet).Like most massively multiplayer games, PlanetSide 2 is best enjoyed with friends.TL;DR: Unless you have an atrocious download speed/cap, there is no excuse not to try PlanetSide 2.\n",

      "~Personal Review~Pros:Crafting - Literaly everythingHouses - Build whatever you want from a wide selection of materials its awesome!Weapons - Many to choose from ranging from starter spears to rocket launchersLeveling - Increase base stats + Engram points that allow you to unlock certain building featuresDino - Lots of dinos + taming!Group exp - Gain more exp near tribe members! So there is an added bonus to play with friends!Cons:Houses - Building structures for houses are really expensive. Especially if you have a low gathering speed on the server properties, just trying to build a wall could take you maybe 5 minutes?Leveling - Since i play on an Unofficial server it was not long ago that i found out the unofficial servers have a lower experience rate, hence if you do play i suggest when making a server to raise up the expResource - Collecting resources take forever! as i said buildng a structure takes 5 minutes for 1 wall just by UPing the gathering speed to lets say 3x makes a world of a difference, though keep in mind its a little OP against trees.Dino Agro - Even though the game is designed to play alongside dino's I cannot stress at how much i hate certain dino's such as the spinosaur! its equivalent to a \"creeper\" in \"minecraft\" for me.Combat - Combat depending on how good your internet is or what server you're playing on, can either be okay, or SUPER LAGGY! though i am now playing on my friends server i don't experience combat fighting issues.Solo - The game is EXTREMELY boring playing by yourself. IMOFirst spawn - There is no tutorial on how to do things, so it is really confusing on how to learn to do anything, hence it is not very \"noob\" friendly, It took me a while to make anything lol.Interface - The interface to your inventory or crafting system can be improved, imo its very confusing for me, though you get used to it, it took a while and everything is scattered everywhere.TL;DRIf you want to play this game, make sure you:Host a serverPlay with friendsUP the EXP and Gathering RatesWatch a how to start off in ARK videoENJOY :D\n",

      "What can I say? After 1000 hours I still feel unwelcome in the obnoxious community and still get absolutely stomped, but I just cannot put this masterpiece down. Defense of the Ancients was a pioneer of the Moba genre and it's sequel remains a strong contender with the likes of Smite and League of Legends. Dota 2 offers a pool of over 100 absolutely free heroes and both a casual and competitive approach. However you choose to play the game you'll be met with an array of toxic, cussing and hateful individuals who will trash talk and rage at you for the simplest mistake. A thick skin is necessary to obtain full enjoyment out of Dota 2. Ignoring the savage community, Dota 2 has perhaps the most engaging, entertaing and satisfying gameplay ever. It feels amazing to initiate a succesful teamfight or to just win a close game. Most heroes are balanced meaning most victories are owed to the skills of the players, however a keen sense of mechanics knowledge is mandatory due to the game's reliance on different damage types and various other integral factors. Whilst it can be difficult as a new player, persistence and resilience can introduce you to many hours of fun. For the best possible experience, playing with friends will both save you from hateful people and allow you to synergise your strategies. Dota 2 is free, so you have nothing to lose from buying it except maybe your social life.\n",

      "The first time I played CS:GO I was incredibly disappointed. I had just recently come from Call Of Duty on the good old PS3. I couldn't aim down sights, I couldn't run and gun, I didn't know how to control recoil and I had no idea what callouts to say. Since I was useless at Competitive, I played deathmatch (COD influenced me into playing dm) where I was continuously shot from all different angles and was struggling to have a 0.5 KD. My first 90 hours only had a few Competitive games thrown in where I managed to win 1 of them. However, on the holidays my friends would mainly play CS:GO and I joined in. This time was when I began to appreciate CS:GO as an amazing game. It has so many features that many games simply do not have. CS:GO also has a thriving community with millions of people playing every month. There's also the market. There are so many weapon skins available. This game has become one of my favourite games. However, there are some things that aren't necessarily bad, but some people may not like them. Such as the graphics, deathmatch spawns and the skill level required to play well may be a large turn off for people. If you do buy this game, GLHF.\n",
      "I have been playing this game for a while now before it was Greenlit on Steam so please don't take the amount of time on Steam into consideration. This game is my favourite Early Access game. It is great fun, especially when you're in an APC with a friend on the MG and you roadkill people. There are 5 classes that you can choose from. Infantry, Tank Crewman, Pilot, Paratrooper and Recon. You start off as an Infantry soldier and as you level up you can decide to transfer to a different type of soldier.But, the three best things in the game are riding around in the massive maps on a civilian bicycle while ringing the bell or roadkilling pesky German troops while in an APC or combining those with friends.This is a great game and I can't wait until the next update and the release of the final game! To the devs, keep up the great work! 10/10\n",

      "\"Payday 2 puts you and three friends in the role of a criminal gang who steal, destroy, kill, make drugs, steal some more and make lots of money doing so. Some missions are for the sneaky, some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty. The missions are short yet engaging, the atmosphere fun rather than immersive, and the rewards simple: More money, more guns and more masks. Yes, masks are a thing. You would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn't you? And you would be wrong.... but don't think about it for now.Now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game, but the AI is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels. But probably the best thing about this game is the community and the development team for the game. There are constant updates and new heists, new weapons, new skills and even new faces. Some of these will cost you, and some are free, but in the end for the sheer amount of time I have spent in this game, and the fun I have had, this game and all its DLC have been superb value for money.\" - Gopher (YouTuber/LiveStreamer)Sums it up well :)\n",

I wouldn't call it the most polished game, considering the single player aspect of it isn't the best, due to the friendly AI's inablility to do much, except shoot and move around. With friends or without, multiplayer gameplay is insanely addictive and amusing. However, stealth is a bit finicky, bugs are quite rampant, and the community can be quite undesirable.\n",

      "Counter Strike Global Offensive is a great game. I think changes can be made with the banning system for competitive for example not having to wait a whole day to play another competitive match -_-. But thats my opinion. this game is nicley finished with the graphics on medium it still looks just as good as you see teams like Fnatic or Dignatitus play with. I think personaly that Dust || can have much less play time i think ive played over 1000 matchs on the god damn map. the community is great when you are not matched with idiots. The skins in this game are really nice love em' when you finally get that skin you want out of a case the amazment is just great most of the time im speachless but its great. Stattracks are a great idea Valve im personaly not a fan of some of the skins  but most of them are great and good looking and  money can be made $$. The knife, teh knife so rare and they cost so much to buy off the market. Look over all Counter Stike Global Offensive is a great game that i would play all day if i could. If you think this is another COD game your are mistaken my friend it is better than battlefield and COD combined.Over all i would give CS:GO  a 9.5/10 for the simple reason for having to wait so long when beeing banned\n",

They have hit the bullseye in making a different game entirely!Many people look at the cover of the book and toss it away, saying \"it's a copy of minecraft\" or \"the graphics are bad\", but when you give it a shot it really proves the cover responce wrong.On my first experience playing the game I've noticed newcomers for the game will feel a little overwelmed at first. But until you get the hang of the game, it gets very enjoyable. Especially with a friend playing along side with you.the only negitave thing I myself can say about Robocraft is how new players in tier 1 can be put up aganst players who pay to get tier 4 weapons. Which i think is quite unfair. THe only thing I can point out to improve on is how they matchmake the players, the ranking strategy does not seem to work.Other than that I would give this game an overall score of 7.5 out of 10. Great game Freejam!\n",
      "The best Co-op game i have ever played. Its near impossible to play without at least one other friend, but with a group of people it is one of the funnest and most strategic games out there.\n",
      "I've played Nether, Dayz, Breaking Point and all the others and where this game is NOW beats all them hands down. The game feels polished and is incredibly fun, best played with friends for a fun, back stabbingly, zombie nommingly hilarious experience. 10/10 would eat rotten cabbage and mouldy water again.\n",
      "Definitely one of the best free to play games out there, TF2 is a game that's great to play with friends and provides hours of fun with all sorts of different game modes and maps.\n",
      "I've been falsely VAC banned on this game before, but legitimate cheaters are always plaguing matches.CSS is better than this and that's a simple fact. In CSS you can't spray, there's no RNG and it's more balanced. In CSGO, you can spray with weapons like the Bizon, there is so much RNG with your weapon accuracy and the weapons arsenal is biased in favour of the Terrorist team.One of the biggest turnoffs is the extremely toxic community. Let us compare CSS and CSGO once again: In CSS you had chill, down to Earth people who you could talk to, make friends, learn about the game, etc. CSGO's community on the other hand is full of raging tryhards who flame everyone, even their own team, and act like they're the hot shot who is carrying the team. Additionally, you have a lot of hackers and dodgy Russians on VPNs trying to scam you.Oh yeah, and the ranked system is stupid too because it seems to be completely unable to match up players of a similar skill.\n",
      "Now what can i say about trove? first of all when my friends introduce this to me i was a bit skeptical. At first glance through just pictures it looked boring to me but i wanted to give it a shot since my friends were all hyped about it, and i can tell you this, this game is worth the shoti had soo much fun playing this with friends and questing with them, the aspect and atmosphere of the game makes it enjoyable and not taken too seriously just pure casual fun. i would definetly love to see where this game takes off in the future and for now im just having a blastto put it to straight terms. If world of warcraft and minecraft had a baby it would be trove.\n",
      "Killing Floor seems to be in a style that isn't seen to often in the gaming industry, as a true Survival Horror co-op game. Unlike other sorts of these games, such as Left 4 Dead for instance, this game does not follow as storyline at all. You spawn into the level, and you either survive or die. 6 different classes to experiment with: Sharpshooter, Support, Berserker, Demolition, Firebug and Medic, means you'll definitely find your preferred play style A great game, constantly being updated by its developers, (it does seasonal cosmetic changes in game, which are always fun), made even more enjoyable when played with friends.\n",
      "This game is really awesome, it brings what a videogame needs Intesity,challenge and etertainment. I really recommend this game to gamers who enjoy coming together with their friends and having adventures with them especially with all the different characters you can get!! Awesome Game\n",
      "Garry's Mod is one of the oldest games out there on steam. However, it's still one of the most popular and most played games on Steam. Garry's Mod is an endless sandbox game which is a sandbox version of the well and known played game, Half Life 2. This allows the user to interact with many things such as objects, cars, ragdolls, etc. From this, the user is able to create anything, they can build contraptions, boats, vehicles, houses, towers, etc. The possibilities are endless! From my experiences, I have overall spent 3,000+ hours onto this game and I've never gotten bored of it yet, not even a little since not only does Garry's Mod include Sandbox mode, there are many more other modes. Some made by Garry and the rest made by the Garry's Mod Community. In addition, Garry's Mod also includes a workshop which allows people to upload their work of art, new items such as weapons, maps, vehicles, etc. Garry's Mod is mostly made up by the community. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to everybody highly because of the price and the infinite possibilities.And there's the other side.

I dont like slim shady because its white with yellow ginger ale with the straw hat pirate such as ruffy and soro. Tom clancy and batman will beat the pink bean and sleeping dog chinese mafia will ♥♥♥♥ the triads in japan. We will never forget pearl harbour sho. You are the sickest ♥♥♥♥ in the world who eats whale and i maplestory. Maplestory is racist to japanese and muslim people because at nautilias has a ♥♥♥♥ing giant ♥♥♥ whale with bombs in it so it offends people who died at pearl harbour u ♥♥♥♥s. Thankyou for reading my review on storymaple.After further inspection of this game i have come to the conclusion that my ♥♥♥♥ was ripped out of my mothers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by zakum and his friends. After 1 day of intense diarrhea and gameplay my ♥♥♥♥ was circumcised by an african slave. im sorry mum please dont read this. After getting to level 50 my chinese side of my ♥♥♥♥ kicked in and shrinked at least 12 inches which means my ♥♥♥♥ is now 8 inches. Maplestory is a really fun game but i had no one to play with. I met some asian guy who was at least 60 years old who had a fetish for feet. I am now writing this review as a vietnamese immigrant is with my friend and probably playing this game. I traveled to the heaven after the undead dragon came back to life and ripped the anal plug from a japanese mans ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n",
      "Before you read this please note that I have been playing this game since I can remember and have only had it on Steam for a short while and don't have much to play now days. This game is awesome! It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game. You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over. All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!! Just cause I don't think any game can be a 10/10 but if a game can be 10/10 then this is the game!\n",

      "Takedown: Red Sabre is a one-of-its-kind for our current games that are avaliable, i find this game challenging but rewarding with each room cleared the more assured of victory i am, This game makes you look tactical and feel like James Bond i highly recommend buying and playing this with friends, if you are looking for a DIFFERENT FPS than the usual i would chose this. I find personally the silence around corners chilling but soothing, a different take then a high intense action game with the main objective to get HyperKills and PentaDeaths. This game keeps me on my toes and changes the spawns of Ai on every new lobby created. 9/10 based on originality and focus.\n",

      "Damn son, these dudes I know along with myself pre-ordered this when it was announced, and we proceeded to play the life out of it during the beta with our keys. At the time it was glorious, then it died off quick due to a lack of heists / goals / content & other needy whingy reasons.Then a week or so I picked it back up, and I found that we all enjoyed it again, doubly so with all the new heists, weapons, masks & prestige system. Put bluntly, Payday 2 is about roleplaying criminals performing various nefarious heists and other seedy malpractice pertaining to the lower echelons of the American law system. It can be considered hard to pick up, hard to master and hardcore to play, however once you have it down, it is a grand experience with friends and random players alike (or so I have found). The game features heists that are inspired by classic and cheesy crime films from another era, which add to the charm, and each job provides a multitude of methods to complete them, and reach that long-awaited payday (cause you need your payday, too). The soundtrack is pumping, and can be customised to play different tunes, or random ones if you so desire. The weapons are smooth, and provide great flexibility in terms of modding. There are skill trees you can specialise in, or spread over broadly to give yourself a malleable role in heists.In conclusion, this is a very good game, and has even managed to pull off DLC that contains direct reference to other games due to OVERKILL's charm with game developers like Valve & DICE.You should get it. :)\n",
      "Man, considering I've pumped almost 500 hours into Warframe; a game I originally did not enjoy, I'd say its worth your time.That is, however, dependant on your viewpoints regarding both third person shooters and also science fiction themes. It also may require a bit of patience, so if that's not your thing, or you can't enjoy something for the sake of enjoyment, please, try something else.Warframe is at core, somewhat of a grindfest at current, but for some people (myself included), this can be made fun with a little imagination, and a simple appreciation of the way the game handles and looks. You play as a Warframe, whom is tasked with various objectives and goals in missions that you select from a series of nodes you unlock as you progress across a map of our galaxy. These range from Capture - wherein you chase down, and kill and then absorb a capture target, before extracting whilst being shot at by mutlitudes of enemies - to things like Survival and Defense, which involve trying to keep your life support system above 0% by slaying foes and collecting the life capsules they drop and defending a Warframe pod that contains a cryo-frozen Warframe soldier inside respectively. There are more missions, which I will not go into detail about, but they can all prove fun.The game is primarily free to play, although has a micro-transaction system in place that allows boosters, weapons and Warframes themselves to bought outright. This balances out toward people who dislike grinding to achieve things. The only things I would consider pay-to-win (and they aren't truly, as they can still be attained - though rarely - freely through alerts), are Orokin Catalysts and Orokin Reactors. These items are one-time use, and boost a weapon or Warframe's modification capacity respectively, allowing you to change and add more to the ojbect in order to increase its power or to make even cooler builds.The game up to this point was not entirely user-friendly, and much of its mechanics and nuances had to be learnt via friends or guides, or just by simply asking in game, but recently a new addition - the Codex - was added to the main menu UI that allows tutorials to be accessed freely. So that's cool.Now onto the cool part, the Warframes. They appear as exo-suits or armour that encompasses a person, and they grant mysterious and awesome powers that pertain to each different frame. Volt, for instance, has abilities that let him control and manipulate electricity in the level, killing enemies and shielding allies with it. He is just one of plenty unique frames and all are acquirable for free. Your only restraint will be slots in your inventory to hold these frames (and weapons too), though this can be increased via buying platinum - the paid currency (or trading for paltinum, if you find a rare item).Story is a bit limited at the moment, and so is the end-game. But this has been slated for fixation by the end of this year, or even earlier.To conclude, Warframe is cool.\n",

      "As a game I picked up for $4 during a sale that I've currently pulled 8 hours out of, I'd have to say that so far it's definitely worth it.  Combat is simple but fun and raiding in parties with friends or even just with other players is quality banter.  The grinding isn't too monotonous and the ability to choose crew/captain traits allows you to decide if you want to level up by trading, exploring or combat- or a mix of the three to keep things interesting.\n",

      "this game does have a lot of problems like unbalanced guns and vehicles, but it is still a great game to play with friends, it shows a lot of potential but at the moment the devs arent doing much to balance anything or fix bugs. the game will take some grinding to get the guns you want or you can just pay2win (the prices are wayyyyy too much). altogether this game feels like a more basic battlefield mixed in with some medal of honour. i would play this game but get prepared for heavy grinding and unfair games at times.9/10\n",
      "Welp here is my kinda quick who gives a damn about spelling review on the crew, Even though everyone gave this game ♥♥♥♥ before it had even come out due to ubisoft and how they are but This is coming from someone who is max level and finished the story,Pros- The game looks really nice,cars are very nice to look at and sound very nice, the map feels very large and has lots of different terrain and weather which does effect the handling which is good. The story is rather enjoyable for a racing game and it is an adult level story not some dumbed down kids friendly story that makes me want to cry (Test Drive 2 im looking at you), The cars handle well for what they are and upgrading does actually make the cars feel better to drive.Cons- (ohboiherewego.jpg) Welp this game does have its fair share of cons so far. The whole name of the game is the crew, which is funny conisdering me and my friends cant join each others crews, and the fact most of the time you are playing you never see anyone else driving around, and teleporting to friends to see them doesnt help because they never show up on your screen. Another con would be the huge lack of support with these problems and how none of the devs seems to care about the connections problems (Which isnt good considering this game is apparently an mmo, and an mmo with connection issues isnt a good thing). The last few cons would be gameplay based, the other ai racers in this game are either so stupid they drive into rivers or they are so rediculously op that they cant be caught even by the best of drivers in the best of cars, and the last con would be im having a problem where the game seems to take control of the car and ♥♥♥♥ you up at the worst of times.Final thought: Even with this extensive amount of cons i would still reccommend this game as the majority of these cons will be fixed within the next few days (hopefully) and the game is rather enjoyable otherwise.\n",

I would recomend everyone to play this game as it is free to play and free to uninstall.\n",

      "Garry's Mod (or Gmod) is a great Sandbox game to build many things and learn about different mechanics in the game. You can build with friends or on your own, or you can just muck around like crazy. This includes attaching engines to a round-a-bout and then activating the engines when standing on it. Also, there are various gamemodes, for example: Prophunt (a hide-n-seek game), Trouble in Terrorist Town (a murder type game), DarkRP, or the standard Sandbox mode can be called a gomemode. A must-get game. 10/10\n",
      "I began playing Dota 2 at a time when I thought \"MOBA\" games were the weakest of the game genres. I always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever I saw gameplay videos of Dota 2 - I had no idea what the heck was going on. It never occured to me though, that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime. When I first started Dota, there were some training missions I had to go through. These explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually, I thought I knew what I was doing. Also, I also thought there would've been some sort of story mode (Due to the way the training was presented). Unfortunately, there was none but I could see some potential for a story-like mode.Although during my first public matchup, I did feel like quiting because I really did have no idea what I was doing and my \"teammates\" were complaining about how bad I was TO THE OTHER TEAM (That's right; the other team/our enemies). Then they all began calling me a noob. The amount of insults I received were terrible, but eventually I had a few other friends play the game along with me and that's when things began to change. That's when Dota 2 became something I actually loved to play because of friends, and because my friends and I got better. It came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them. Everytime we do that, it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not. That's what Dota 2 is for me: having a good time with friends and having fun.I then tried LoL and I came to the conclusion:Dota 2 > LoLSo since this game is free to play, I highly recommend it. It's free so I say, \"Why not?\". It's best played with people you know, after all- it is a team based game. There are more things to talk about in Dota, but if you want to know what they are, play the game. Experience it.\n",
      "This is a game that definitely needs to be tried. Divers vs Sharks. The tension felt while playing as the divers is comparable to the excitement of hunting them down as a shark. There's nothing better than tackling an unsuspecting diver out of the room they're defending while his buddies watch on. Or using temwork to take down one of the ocean's greatest predators.The game is pretty well balanced, but as the divers you definitely need teamwork and communication to get the edge over the sharks.There've been numerous updates since release, with the addition of a new game-mode, new sharks, and new equipment, so the developers are certainly keen on keeping this project going from first impressions.If you like PvP games, definitely give this one a go with a few friends.\n",

      "Well, What CAN you say to one of the biggest games on Steam and a great, hilarious, stupid 1st person shooter? Its got gore, guns, and great gameplay. Or at least fun gameplay with your friends on a community or Steam created map with your own classes and loadouts. Evil camping snipers or raging heavys will try to take you out in this hectic shooter. Collect items and create new ones. It's a great game that every Steam player must have or simply he can't have fun. Great Game, lacks updates but the community releases and indes bring new life to the game!8/10\n",
      "Sid Meier's Civilization V also known as Civ 5 was the first game that brought combat simulation and real world tactics toghether to create a seamless game where you can destory or protect both friends and foes. The DLC Packs: Gods & Kings and Brave New World are overpriced at $25 each however they did provide just enough content to satisfy me. I think because there is such an active community making new mods and maps this game will continue in the future with more DLC being released, Fingers crossed it provides more bang for your buck. Overall great game with awesome simulation and many factors within the gameplay. :) Great Game! 9/10\n",

      "From the time of posting this review I have only played 1 hour. I will now share with you what I did in this 1 hour, Enjoy...P.S - I played a total of 120 hours of Fallout 4 on the Xbox One (so far) and was the first Fallout title I played, My friend(s) recommended me this game as they belived it was the best game in the Fallout Franchise (And I'm cheapskate and took the two dollar deal for the game).I started a new save and watched the opening cutscene, it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I then actually got into the game and met and old man that looked like a child molester. I then made my character. For some reason I decided to make him look like a ♥♥♥♥ing black pedophile who went head first into an ocean of bleach. Thought it would be a good idea to name him 'Long Slong John'. I then immediately stole everything from the old white man. I walked outside and wondered if there was a sprint key, I then realised that the devs decided that thier defintion of sprinting is hobbling along the ground like a man with no arms and no legs struggling to move. Their defintion of walking is the same man but is incapable of remembering to breath. I then went to meet up with Sunny. I walk into the saloon and find Sunny, then I proceed to stare at her Ta-Tas for several minutes. Talk to Sunny and proceeded to ask her to teach me ♥♥♥♥. She said that we are going to shoot some ♥♥♥♥ing bottles. Went out back and shot some bottles like a legend. Talked to Sunny again and asked for work. She said that we could go shoot up some geckos. We then walked like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disabled persosns to the where the geckos were located. At first thought of 'Geckos', I thought that they would be small as ♥♥♥♥ so I then stared directly at the ground. I was sadly mistaken. Some ♥♥♥♥ing big ♥♥♥ Geckos come racing at me. I said and I quote: 'WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THOSE!?', which was then followed by 'AAAARRRRGGGGHHH! GET THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY FROM ME!'. I then killed them Godzilla Geckos and claimed my reward.What a ♥♥♥♥ing hour.

      "As to this date I have only played 36 hours of this wonderful game which, most of those hours on record, were spent doing drive-bys with my friends in a stolen SWAT van or racing one another to the nearest RPG and then intending to blow eachother up with said RPG.

      "Great game to play alone or with friends. Take on waves of monsters with a huge variety of weapons, classes and maps.

      "Review on Portuguese and EnglishAnálise em Português e InglêsReview on EnglishAnálise em InglêsSUMMARY: Insurgency is a FPS (First-Person Shooter) game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade (this depending on the server). Even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting, it's exclusively focused to the cooperative (against AI-controlled bots) and to the Multiplayer (against real enemies).Entering the game, the player can choose to join the Insurgents team or to the Security team, both have their own classes, weapons and customizations, but even so, the game can keep very well balanced during the match.Currently, Insurgency has 7 different game modes in the Multiplayer, which the maximum server capacity is 32 players, about the cooperative match, the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 players.GRAPHICS: As for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum, even with many elements present during a match the game doesn't need a very good PC to run, the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish, the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses, but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games, I think the graphics are similar to CS:GO. There are some mods at Steam Workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the game.SOUNDS / AUDIOS: Another extremely positive point of Insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons, environments and explosions, they can make you get fully into the game, because it seems that you are in a real war, and also, you can download some mods in Steam Workshop that will improve the effect and the experience, letting the game more real (or funny). PING / FPS: The game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers (if you can run CS:GO on low graphics at 60 FPS, probably can play Insurgency without any problem), and servers respond very well, even with 200 ping, you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplay.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism, so it becomes a bit more complicated than other FPS games we are used to, always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands. If you are new to FPS games, maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty, 'cause you don't have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet. To the veterans on FPS games can be sure that Insurgency will make you become better at basically every other FPS you play or have played.The physics in the game is a little weak, it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesn't work so much, for example the bodies don't react too well to bullets.I didn't find any individual cheating, or doing some bug.DEVELOPERS: Assets and attentive, the Insurgency Support/Development Team is an example, always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game, unlike many other games, the Developer/Support Community of Insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public, as an example, they play matches with us. You can contact them through Steam if you need something, which makes the service be much faster and easier.COMMUNITY: In the sense of Insurgency Players Community, I can not analyze in relation to Asian, Oceania or Africa servers, but the American (all the America, not only U.S.A.) and Europe community are very warm and friendly (also very funny, ALLAHU AKBAR) at every match that I played I didn't find any rager or any that harm your gameplay (such as abusing the voice chat, abusing the chat, or kill his own team with intent). The players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay (some mods are very hilarious), also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very cool.Análise em PortuguêsReview on PortugueseRESUMO: Insurgency é um jogo FPS (First-Person Shooter) tático com elementos que tendem para o realismo porém podem ser configurados para deixá-lo bem arcade (isso dependendo do servidor). Mesmo com o jogo não tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante, a sua proposta é exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo (contra Bots controlados por IA), e para o Multiplayer (contra inimigos reais). Ao entrar na partida, o jogador poderá escolher entre se unir ao time de Insurgentes ou ao time de Segurança, ambos possuem suas próprias classes, armas e customizações, mas mesmo assim, o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partida.GRÁFICOS: Em relação aos gráficos é possível afirmar que é impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizá-los ao máximo, mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso não o torna pesado de maneira alguma, se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente, o detalhamento dos cenários e das armas também impressiona.SONS/ÁUDIOS: Outro extremo ponto positivo de Insurgency é a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas, ambientes e explosões, é possível você se imergir totalmente ao jogo, por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente está em uma guerra, no Workshop também é possível você alterar alguns sons de armas, explosões, e outros efeitos para deixá-lo ainda mais real.PING/FPS: O jogo possui uma renderização muita boa a qual o faz ser possível de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes (se você consegue rodar CS:GO com gráficos baixos a 60 FPS, provavelmente conseguirá jogar Insurgency sem nenhum problema), e os servidores respondem muito bem, até 200 de ping é possível você jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferença ou interferência durante sua gameplay.JOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade do Insurgency é um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de FPS que estamos acostumados, sempre sendo muito fluída e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados, caso você seja iniciante em jogos do gênero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rápida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma noção de cobertura avançada. Aos mais veteranos em jogos FPS posso ter certeza que Insurgency fará com que você se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros FPS' que você joga ou já jogou, por conta da estratégia e velocidade de reação que é necessária durante a partida.Não consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no próprio jogo.DESENVOLVEDORES: Ativos e atentos, a equipe de desenvolvimento do Insurgency é um exemplo, sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer dúvida ou problema que você tenha no jogo, ao contrário de muitos outros jogos, a comunidade desenvolvedora de Insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o público jogando até mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores, é possível contatá-los através da Steam caso necessite de algo, o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rápido e fácil.COMUNIDADE: No sentido da comunidade de jogadores do Insurgency, eu não posso analisar em relação a servidores asiáticos, da Oceania ou africanos, porém a comunide americana (toda a América, não só EUA) e europeia é muito amigável e receptiva (além de muito engraçada, ALLAHU AKBAR), em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros (como abusar do canal de voz, canal de texto, ou matar a própria equipe com intenção). O jogo permite que a comunidade poste Mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir.\n",
      "Every once, or even sometimes twice in a lifetime, you find that special game. A game which you enjoy so much, you just love it even if it isnt the greatest game. For me, that game is terraria, I've spoken to plenty of people who say \"it is fun, but gets quite repetetive\" and \"its enjoyable but a lot of missed potential\" but to me, its one of my favourite games. Ever since I bought it about 3 years ago, its been near the top of my top 10 games ever. Ive clocked in over 520 hours in it and have enjoyed every single one. This game is certainly worth the $10 dollar price, but I would say its worth a lot moreWhether playing alone or with your friends, this game is sure to suck up hours of your time, my biggest fault with it, is that it's not avalible for macs so i cant play it with all my friends, but other then that, its amazing. I give it a 10/10\n",
      "One Of the greatesss sandbox games out there if your thinking to get this game or not just get it youll have lot of fun theres a ♥♥♥♥ load of mods that you can go get and have fun the best way to play this game is with friends that the only way to get the full funness\n",
      "Amazing game to play with friends\n",
      "A criminally underrated game of its time. Psychonauts was one of the hidden gems of my gaming generation with massive potential that unfortunately will not be getting a sequel. While it's cartoony graphics style may hold up well for gaming, the cutscenes show its age. An untapped concept, this game is definitely one of a kind. At the moment.As a platformer, Psychonauts harkens back to my generation's version of platforming in a large detailed, explorable world, akin to that such as Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. Each level is heavily stylised; from the controlled psyche of your teachers hiding a tragic memory, the colourful and creative mind of an artist consumed with ideas to the deranged, paranoid fantasies of a madmen/sleeper. Everything fits perfectly and everything is literally a mind-changing experience.The cast and range of characters are unique, even dark at some moments if analysed carefully. The children are all idiosyncratic in their personalities, the adults as well, in particular Ford Cruler, the serious Sasha Nein and hip-trendy Milla Vordello. The game feels alive with personality as you can talk and listen in to conversations with the other kids, watch as relationships are broken and made between friends and Razputin is an interesting and fun protagonist to see the game through. I do love Mikhail, Boyd, Fred, G-Men and Soleil.The details put into this game is staggering, perhaps outdoing those of any modern RPGs in terms of dialog and in-game interactivity, hacking the game reveals fully voiced responses to items and skills which would otherwise be not available at its time in the game. There's even an item that if continued with the story, is only held for about 5-10secs before it is lost forever, however, if used with people, reveals unique responses from the entire cast. And literally every item in the game has spoken dialogue.The game also works well with controller and I highly recommend it, as most platformers should be played with controllers on PC. I used my PS3 Dualshock with motionjoy.I definitely will encourage this game to anyone looking for an interesting and surely different gaming experience. Oh! Try everything on everyone, you'll be surprised! :DProps to Alan Blumenfeld (as Boyd, and the wonderful vocal inflexion in his verbal tic as the character), Tara Strong (as bloody usual =_=;) and André Sogliuzzo (for the amazing voice-acting of the two sides of a split personality of different nationalites.)\n",

      "This game is hard. It's a game you need dedication with and patience. It has truly stunning visuals and a great community. The game isn't just a pick up and go type, you have to really try and you will succeed! I remember getting my first few killstreaks and feeling like the champ, only to be slain from behind. It is an amazing game with more than enough servers, game modes, classes, weapons to keep you busy! Some times it can be a little buggy but others you have great matches with people (That I become close friends with!) and be busy chopping at them head!This game truly is an instant engravement into my heart.\n",
      "   English review :Best documentary about what is e-sports, behaps the focus is only on DotA, show how big is this place. Who says a simple game can be something giant like a mundial tournament.This movie doesn't only for DotA specially but for every single competitive game. Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   Análise em português :Melhor documentário sobre o que é e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, já mostra o quão incrível é essa área. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme não serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E também levanta uma grande reflexão, será que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, família, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que você gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que você não jogue DotA assista esse documentário, vale muito a pena, eu não jogo mas é a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lançou ano passado e é inacreditável a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que são e-sports, além do mais é apenas 1h29m.:D :)\n",
      "THe level of detail in this game is magnificent. The story is compelling, the fights are fun, the amount of choices you have, and the ways they impact the game just make it a joy to play.I reccomend that you don't look at any of the game's promo material. Don't ask your friends about this game. Don't ask for help on Yahoo Answers. Instead play it, completely blind. Take the risk, because the reward is just amazing.\n",
      "9/10 would lose another friend again\n",
      "really fun to play with friends\n",
      "The way the gameplay sets out is unique yet remincent to older retro games. Humour is to be had in the majority of the conversations, and rich with quirky tropes within the many NPCs. It calls into question old logic, while bringing its own chaos. The different guidelines in playthrough styles allows one to easily differentiate between the two, instead of just a touchup of color and a witty remark. Not only that, one is able to easily suit into a styling of their choosing, the passive being light-hearted and compassionate,  while the violent taking a frustrated and disconnected attitude (This could be seen negatively in the case of frustration, but meh. You'll deal with it)If you want to take a jab in the feels, I would recommend.If you want to embrace all the friends around you, I recommend.If you want to slaughter a land you know only a brief amount and the humourous inhabitants, I (reluctantly) recommend. (The killing part, not the recommend part)Though I must warn you...   You're in for a bad time. \n",
      "A very interesting game, in which after a while I did get bored of. Not going to say this game is bad or anything, it just loses its fun after a while.10/10 game needs more tlcBasically get this game to play with friends and not because you have enough $$$\n",

      "I dont know why i didn't recommend this sooner. Probably one of my favorite games on steam ever. If any of my friends don't have Garry's Mod, Get it while its cheap, totally worth the money.\n",
      "This is easily one of the best games I have purchased. I reccomend it to everyone; except people that hate the following: losing, feeders, Russians, the Chinese, people that think they're better than they are, people who think they're worse than they are, 10 hour downloads, good grades, an education, spare time, friends, girlfriends, other people, bad games, good games, exercise, social situations, supports that feed, carries that feed, overpowered carries, noobs on your team, pros not on your team, Pyrion Flax, absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and getting completely stuck for over five seconds whilst being beaten to death by a supremely overpowered carry that doesn't even have a face.10/10 would download again.\n",
      "The game is good however when i que with my friends, we can never find a game, it says match starting in 5 seconds then says no game has been found, we spend a good 30 times atleast to find one game. Please fix this issue and it'll be hectic and on a plus side please add crowman as a new killer who glides on people.\n",
      "Great cooperative fps, working with you friends to achieve a similar goal.Weather that goal is to run into a night club and kidnap the DJ or kill and Elvis impersonator at a casino without anyone knowing whilst wearing a santa mask.Would recomend it to anyone that likes to pull of the occasional heist.10/10\n",
      "Great game, great to play with friends!\n",
      "It is very nice but well its not worth the money.TBH it rarely works on my system and so many complains from my friends.Also it kinda sucks if you don't have friends.Anyway if you have a good com and a lot of friends you should get this game when there are more patches that make the game worth while or wait till the full game is out and get it on a cheap sale.\n",
      "this game is a great MMO RPG for peopple who like to battle, explore and gear up with thier friends. its a great game and its free! So no need for payment just download and start. When i first played this i was impressed by the amount  of people playing. it also has many different playing styles and ways to explore with friends! I personally think this is a great game for the one who like to explore with friends and strangers.\n",
      "Tales from the Borderlands is a fun and emotional experience. I feel like some choices didn't weigh as heavy as past Telltale stories but instead fortified or weakened the bonds between friends. Overall I'm glad I played this game and would reccomend it to any fan of the borderlands games or someone looking for a worthwhile story experience.\n",
      "Really fun game, wack it on with 2-4 controllers and you'll be having a blast. Very easy to pick up, very hard to master. Each level throws your previous plan out the window (which I like) while still allowing certain players to stick with certain roles. I work in hospitality so it is satisfying to assign players roles and watch everyone work together as a well oiled machine. Only critisism would be that local co-op only limits play time when you don't have a couple of friends to play with. This is not a loss for the game, however it limits the amount of time I will play it. I would also say that there are some frustrating quirks in the game such as food getting stuck on corners of benches and plates getting fused into the sink. These are incredibly minor and do not degrade from the experience heavily as more plates and more food are available.9/10 definitely a fun one to have a couple of beers and play.\n",
      "Can't stop playing this game!There is so much content and so many things to do1. you can pee sittin down like a ♥♥♥♥♥2. you can eat3. you can have naughty conversation with friends online4. you can watch your shrimp swim around in their tank5. you can play with a man in a cage6.

      "My friends suck. 10 minutes into the game two of my characters have been killed. One of them was 0 years old.\n",
      "Really fun with friends online on a PVP or Arena server. Although the game tends to crash randomly and after playing for a while my FPS drops under 30, which forces me to restart the game to get back up to 60+. Would like better optimization and custom graphics settings.\n",
      "Like a Cards Against Humanity game with more mileage because the answers always change. This game is pure gold with friends & some drinks. :)\n",

      "Contagion is a game that is fun and entertaining when you play with friends. There is a few problems that i recommend you fix. The melee weapons in this game need to be more powerful, I know you probably will already be doing this, but please make it where you can sever limbs and have critical hits. The zombie animations are a little buggy, and will dissapear for no reason. I hope you read this a have a nice day.\n",

      "Well, after reading few reviews regarding this game, frankly, I didn't have high expectations. Nor did I get them to be honest. Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is a standalone version of a Sniper Elite v2, and as most of the games futuring zombies, this game is meant to be coop. It's way more interesting playing in 4 characters, rather than playing alone as game tends to get frustrating if you are playing it solo. The difficulties are hard, but what this game wants from you is to make tactic for each level that will determin on if you are gonna succeed or not. Of course, upon playing with your friends, the enemies are stronger, and you have to apply different attitude towards threats. Anyway, I would recommend this game if you have even one friend to play it with, but if you have more, it's always better. Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is what I think Call of Duty Zombies mode should've been, with this fluid campaign.7/10\n",

      "From the moment the game started it felt a bit too much like a DLC, and if i ignored the technical additions (new inventory interface etc) I would believe it was just a big DLC to Dead Island, but nonetheless, a fun 'DLC'. The story reveals more about what happened with the outbreak of the first game and introduces new zombies, survivors and a couple new weapons too. I think to appreciate this you will need to have played the first game though. The ending leaves you in anticipation of Dead Island 2 and overall, the game is enjoyable and worth a playthrough (better with friends). I'd say, if you enjoyed Dead Island, get it, and if you haven't played that, go get it too.\n",

      "Portal 2 is a very nice and cool sequal to the original Portal 1, this game has very mind bending puzzles, once you get used to it, you will start solving them.Portal 2 has a very intresting storyline, has it happens years after Portal 1, the entire labratory is broken and overgrown, after Chell had defeated GLaDOS, its a game where you play around with portals, and also much more mind bending then the original Portal 1. It introduces new test elements, and brings back old elements in combination, its also very adventurous once you get in the Old Aperture.It also has the Co-op mode, which allows you to play with a friend and solve puzzles together, it also has hats to wear on your Co-op bots you can find from having the hat in TF2 or buying them from the Portal 2 store! You can also buy some gestures to enhance your expirience and have more better emotion showing.Once you have completed coop and single player, You can go to the Perpetual Testing Initive, also PTI for short, it allows you to make your own tests using the test elements, such as ariel faith plates, excursion funnels, gels, and even turrets!The PTI has some very easy controls and you can subscribe to tests on the workshop to play them ingame! In my opinion, PTI is a much easier way to make tests than using Hammer, which is much more complicated to use.Portal 2 is a very fun game if you want to challenge your mind, laugh at the funny quotes, and explore the Aperture Science laboratories further then ever!\n",
      "Garry's Mod is a game to play when your feeling sad or down, Its really nice to play it when you have Valve games installed, its nice to pose things and make things, like a flying car, a giant roller coaster, just about anything you can think, you can take screenshots to show off your skills or put something on the workshop to share with other people! Its also fun to play the multiplayer when your tired of singleplayer, in multiplayer, you can play with friends, play the gamemodes that people make, Or just mess around in the spawn menu! You can also make really funny poses and spawn in really silly stuff. Installing addons in the workshop is really nice if your making very professinal scenes or poses. Garry's Mod also has a really fun community with some very intresting achivements. If you would like to earn them.Remember! Your imagination... Is the limit!\n",
      "Since August 13 (2013) to Dicember (2014) was an amazing coop game, my favourite. I LOVED playing with my friends and with the new ones that i made in the game. I really enjoyed each hour that i spent in this game stealing banks, crafting drugs or when your NOOB friend ♥♥♥♥s everything in a stealth mission. In that time there were only 4 or 5 DCL. I admit, my friends and I used THE DCL UNLOCKER (This hack ONLY UNLOCKS THOSE ♥♥♥♥ING DCL) and we were not kicked or banned (dollar is REALLY EXPENSIVE  in Argentina, i am not gonna pay more than 70 pesos for 1 DCL which include some virtual weapons or a map). Since Dicember (2014) to Nowadays there are 30 DCL. OVERKILL only thinks in money. People stop playing the game, no one buy the game because of all the negatives review. 90% of the negatives reviews complains of all the DCL. And of course there are the small comunity fan that defends the game and buy every ♥♥♥♥ing DLC that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s makes.Oh, and about the DCL UNLOCKER, it can't be used anymore. if you use it you get kicked of every time that you join a heistSUMMARY: 2013 - 2014 BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED 2015 - NOWADAYS IT'S A SIMULATOR WHICH OBJETIVE IS BUY A DCL THAT YOU CAN!\n",
      "How do I explain this game.... This is a grind.... and very boring alone.The first time I played as a warrior with my friends. We got pretty far into the game and pushed through the endless grind of the same thing with different landscapes and we though we were doing pretty good.....Then we got to the capital city..................And we knew we had a long way to go. We made a guild and set of to rid the land of which ever dark power threatened it this time.1 week later we gave up and quit the gameMy second time I tried to continue but I got bored with my character and lost my pet (which I don't know if you get back)I played as a guardian and looked like a ♥♥♥♥.I played with koreans and they made me their ♥♥♥♥♥.I sat there and thought about my life decisions.Overall I think this is a good game that can be refined and developed more but you need friends to quench the grind10/10 would waste life again\n",

      "this game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off more than anything else on my steam (and i own bad rats) but despite the numerous glitches the twelvie cod style community i just keep coming back, because despite all its flaws dayz is a truly amazing game. it has given me experiences no other game could e.g travelling with a stranger for almost 2 hours only for him to vanish on the ship and have me find his body 20 meters away, from walking into a church with my friend that was packed with people only to have us sit in a circle for 5 min and get killed by a single bandit and most recently cooking my first cow after almost starving to death.no game can give the experiences that dayz gives you. Its weird its almost like its countless glitches and horrible community make those positive experiences so much more memorible. Though features are needed, glitches need fixing because despite what i said prior there are countless games just waiting to take dayzs place so its a long road ahead and i really hope dayz doesnt get overshadowed by upcoming games like H1Z1 because deep down this is an amazing game\n",

This is mainly when i'm trying to be stealthy but i turn around just to find a ♥♥♥♥ing mutt ripping my face off.OH GOD I JUST HOPE THAT MY GRAPHICS CARD IS FAULTY, I AM GETTING A NEW ONE AND IF IT STILL GETS THE RANDOM LAG, I WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DECAPITATE MYSELF.Oh, and I recommend the game.\n",
      "If you like Minecraft, you're sure to like rust. It's only in alpha stages, but it's epic.Surviving with friends, pvp, (kitpvp servers are a must play!) or just plain survival, no pvp. Like minecraft, you can have \"mods\" except these mods are more like bukkit plugins. You can find servers with economy, pvp arenas, teleportation, door sharing, kits, and because it's in alpha stage, you're bound to find some really funny bugs. Like when you shoot somebodies head, it stretches out and usually their bodies go flying. Anyway, i recommend this game to everyone, and especially my friends who used to play minecraft.\n",

      "Ark is a very hard game to start off with but once you get into the higher level stuff it gets funner, you make new friends, and you start to hate people to death that you can't deal with, Ark is a game thats worth every cent because you learn how to do stuff and it can be like real life and teach you real life lessons.\n",
      "No More Room In Hell is a teamwork based game, and you need to have reliable team mates to help you. If you are looking for a challenge, try playing it by yourself. The game is a realistic zombie apocalypse, so no crossheirs, no seeing your mates through walls, and worst of all, NO AMMO COUNTER. This game is a lot better than L4D & L4D2, for it's more realistic and forces you to be a team to survive. To sum this all up, I give No More Room In Hell a 10/10. It is a great game to play with your friends, siblings, or even your parents. P.S To make the game feel more creepy play at night. Good luck survivors!\n",
      "Honestly the best fantasy MMO ever. It's just a shame that nowadays the game is pretty much dead. Back in its glory days, EverQuest II was such a magnificent and addicting game, and although now the game is still enjoyable, it gets somewhat saddening to see what's become of it. If you've got a large group of close friends all looking for a fun MMO experience, then please, I urge you to play EQII together, because this game is honestly a blast. If it's just you though, be prepared to walk through empty zones and maps for your entire playthrough.\n",
      "I played for a while, and I just... didn't like it. It was barely an MMO experience. I felt like I was playing a Spongebob PS2 game. It sadly was not a fun thing for me. The puzzles and everything else about it were fine, but I dunno. Maybe it's just me? Maybe I just need friends or something? Who knows.Sorry Spiral Knights.\n",
      "When I first played this game it was very easy to get used to. With quick action from TF2 but as you get more health and the weapons are not as powerful, you require more stratigic moves as in Dota 2 or even LoL. A great combination! I recomended this game to many of my friends and we play it all the time. Great game,10/10\n",
      "wonderful way to ♥♥♥♥ your friends off! :D crashing into them\n",
      "So straight up. It's good.Couple of things wrong with it are the simple bugs and stuff, like the hostile NPC's pathing when you get on a roof top. The dragon (Kur) is kinda a ♥♥♥♥ when he is always on you if you get a little too close to the tower. (seriously, took me 30 mins to gt him away from me after dying 10 times)Good side; crafting is very easy, no need for rare crafting benches or anything. The only rare things are the items to collect for crafting into weapons and armor, but of course, is the fun side of it, the satisfaction of when you grind the land for hours to finally get that last item to make OP gear.For an early game, it's quite enjoyable. It's fun and with the the ability to play along side friends, in such an early game, it's pretty awesome. Seeing this to become a fully completed game would be really good. (expecting some really good graphics and items in the long run)Not for all people, but it's worth a look.\n",
      "XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a HIGHLY recommended game for strategy players especially from the RTS genre. XCOM EU is based from the classic XCOM game and was remade especially for the modern players. Gameplay wise, this is more of a turn based strategy playing and planning for a good executions. This game is also very similar to the old Rainbow Six games such as Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear because of the squad based planning and customization like changing your squad's faces, body, helmet, armor, etc.If you love playing mind games like Chess or Games of the General, this game is highly recommended for you. Of course, you'll end up enjoying it so much that thinking is never been so hard to do. Your head will NEVER hurt in playing this game. 100% guarantee (unless you're frustrated in losing your \"best friend\").I really highly recommend it to you all especially for those who are NOT an RTS fan and turn based gaming. Storyline wise, it is a top notch but the ending is quite \"predictable\". Nevertheless, overall the game is worth to buy and worth the weight!Verdict: 8.9/10\n",

He died and I felt alone. I cried for a bit then found a new player to befriend. I accidently shot him in the head. He won't wake up. Shortly after, I was hit in the head and lost everything but a new pink shirt and my underpants. Day 4: Found the guys who stole my stuff and they handcuffed me, then forcefed me rotten food.

      "simply fantastic, Big Ant did a brilliant job with this game!and I remember watching a friend of mine, Twistie3, playing this on a livestream, with Ross, the CEO or something like that of Big Ant, and it just blew me away, it was like something I had never seen before! So, of course I bought it the day it came  out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic.Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too!FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)\n",

      "I'm quite annoyed that I keep getting this game re-gifted to me by my friends. First, it was Dino: Beatdown, which was totally ordinary and mod-like in presentation (and not a good one at that), second I was gifted Dino: Horde, and I wasn't even sure if it was a different game.  Finally, I was gifted this version, and while better than the other two, I'd hardly call a new engine a few more features a new game. It feels like there is always a new attempt at getting this game finished, it gets some updates, and then promptly disappears under a new title.  Would like to see some sort of \"finality\" (and I mean real finality, not just stop updating it or re-releasing it as something else).  The concept is great, but the delivery is constantly flawed, which is a real shame.\n",

      "This is a game where rushing in without a plan WILL get you killed (especially on higher diffculties if you want to go big).In PAYDAY 2 , planning the right strat . and co-operating with your teammates is key to getting you to your objective ,may it be sneaking out meth from a depot , or stealing weapons from a mafia's private hangar , all these require teamwork to pull off.There are primarily 2 playstyles and 4 skill tress for players to invest in .Loud or stealth. Perks in the skill tress can be unlocked through skill points that you earn through leveling up by completing multiple heists.Technician(Specialise in trip mines and saws,great to bring along for bank heists or maps that have atms) , mastermind (passive and active perks , highly recommnded for those who think they might mess up stealth or specailise in crowd control), ghost(the skill tree says it all , its like the sneaky-ish class of the game where its perks allow you to be fast and silent while being able to hack and take out your enemies one by one) and enforcer(heavy weapons guy,no further explaination needed here).Depending on what playstyle or class you prefer most(you can invest in multiple skill trees , blending different playstyles) , this is going to determine what role you play in the team of 4 players(fixed at 4 every heist) .There are a few key mechenics in the game , which i will point out in a moment .1.CamerasOn most maps , there will usually be cameras scattered around the map which will sound the alarm if they spot you or your associates.These cameras are monitored by a camera guard in a locked room(such doors can be opened through high-level ghosts , drills or keycards if you are lucky enough to find one.In most stealth missions , we heisters take killing the camera guard as the main priority so that we can progress more smoothly .You can shoot out a camera to get a guards attention(this causes them to patrol around the destroyed camera,but not be alerted).However , on higher diffuculties , cameras are protected by a bullet-proof barrier(these cameras are called TiTan cameras) , making it even harder for the heist to be completed.2.Guards Guards spawn throughout different maps and differ from level to level , and will alert other guards and sound the alarm if they spot you , so keep a lookout for these guys.Btw , they also drop a pager after being killed ,and you are required to answer the operator over the pager by pressing f , so dont mess up a nice heist by forgetting to answer them.Guards on different maps also have different health levels(also affected by difficulty levels).3.Stealth I cannot emphasise on this any more than i ever could .STEALTH is the main playstyle of the game(my personal opinion)In most missions , on higher levels , people tend to restart when they are spotted and if he alarm is raised because the resistance is very strong (polica forces have more health ,as well has high dps weapons).SO KEEP TO STEALTH.Finally , what about the communty?Well , occasionally , there WILL BE d***s , however , for the most part , everyones friendly because everyone wants to accomplish that ONE common objective(beware of grenade trolling dough , cause i do those as well ;)  )Trolls will be trolls , haters will be haters , but we will all be hesters , so yes , STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME , AND PLAY IT NOW ,ALL PRAISE OVERKILLLLL\n",

      "At first, I was so damn hesitate with all the negative reviews that took me 2 days to finally buy the game (I was originally intended to buy on the Day 1). So, I went to watch streams for an hour on Youtube, and man, it looks so good I have to buy it for myself.I did not regret that decision at all. This game gets so much better with friends.It's not kind of FPS like COD or BF4, and the enemy is not kind of that much spongey when you play in the right level.Man, don't waste your time reading all those negative reviews. Try it for yourself.If you don't like it, you still can request Steam for the refund.\n",
      "Well, M&B WB has to be the best game i have ever played. It is so replayable, there are hundreds of different combinations, and then slap on a bunch of Mods! You could be an archer for the vaegirs, A crossbowman for your own kingdom, a knight for the swadians. Then there are mods!The combat is a bit under but still tactical and thrilling when you kill an enemy. Playing Multiplayer is fun with friends... or against... Its very tactical but very unforgiving and newbies may get owned but once you start getting a few hours under your belt, you can win.My latest save is Swadians, the epicness of watching about 150 cavalry storming into the Rhodok lines is exhilarating and quite epic.It is hard to describe its greatness but damn me if it aunt great.\n",

      "Real of the Mad God was a great game to play with friends, battling mobs, completing dungeons and getting destroyed by demi-god bosses. It was an amazing game back in the day, making guilds and earning fame towards it gave higher ranks in the guild. Recently over the past year, in opinion the game has declined due to in-game purchases that allow you to get high level weapons and other items that make the game pointless. I see the fact that making money off a game is necessary in some aspects but, buy to win?. The thought of just spending 100 or so dollars on a game to get high level ♥♥♥♥ is quite rediculous. It should be game where hard hours of level up and gaming should be rewarded with high level equipment. The leveling and characters make the game enjoyable, different classes that are aquired when levelling is a great way for more hours in the game making it much more fun. I also enjoyed fame system where even after max leveling has some sort of goal towards the highest fame title. The game is good but needs some areas of improvement like the shop having high level items and the use of money for more ♥♥♥♥.I don't recommend this game to people who dislike buy-to-win games but, it had really good aspects of a good game.\n",

      "Guns of Icarus is and extremely fun game if you enjoy steampunk, firstperson shooters, comanding others, following orders, airships, co-op or just playing with friends. Before I talk about the positives I'm going to talk about the negatives which there are very few of yet still there. To start with it seems to be a bit expensive for what it is, I understand that maybe the devs need a bit more money to get more people into the game. Yet it does seem like it should be F2P seeing as it has microtransactions (optional) a difficult leveling up system and of course having the word online smacked straight into the title (not that all online games are f2p just that lots on steam are). The devs i think would get alot more sales if they lowered their prices down to below $10 or just make it f2p. Also at the time of this review post whenever I go on there only seems to be 100 - 400 people online which, lets be honest, isnt that much for a full online game, I have often either joined back to the same lobby I left or kept running into the same people even on different days. I do also understand that they cant just make more people play their game but this is still a flaw, it just needs time to fix.Dispite these negatives the game is still amazing, it has a vast array of mounted guns, repair tools, ammo types, power ups and it is a very team based game. The most amazing thing I've liked about it so far, is that it isnt just a run and gun shoot anything to move sort of game. There is actual strategy, for example if you had a motar and a gatling gun, yes the motar does more damage yet its not the greatest at taking down shields so you take down the shields with the gatling gun then fire the motar to do extreme damage and it takes down a ship faster then if you just shot wildly at them with both guns. SUM UP:Guns of Icarus is an amazing game and is some of the most fun I've had playing a game, if you're looking for a causual game to play it its probably not the best option but if you're looking for hours of intense fun with friends and other randoms this game is definatly worth the full $15 or even the $30 for 3 other copies to give away to your friends. This game is extremely recommended!\n",

      "This game deserves a big following. Brings back a lot of memories, while bringing in a new, innovative gameplay. It's hard for the first few times, trying to get your head around it, but definitely worth the perseverance. So much fun to play. The array of weapons is ample, and relatively balanced - if you think a weapon sucks, you're bound to meet someone who knows how to really use it. Maps are crazy and interesting. The community that's growing seems very friendly, and I think the small size of games (four players max) helps this.Blunderbuss/10\n",

Travel down the elevators to reach the planets core, Defeat the four major bosses on the way down, aswell as an assortment of mini bosses, this is the game on the surface.As anyother game like it, there is a fair amount of grinding involved, however having friends can make that grinding small or irrelevant, there are many weapons, Guns, Bombs, and Swords to choose from and there are alot of enemies to fight, however, this game does get tedious and repetitive towards the later levels, however there is ample entertainment to distract you from that, including the PvP modes Lockdown and blastnetwork, aswell as Shadowlair, and daily missions. Like most games, getting gear is based primarily on luck, or farming over time, It does not take forever and there are always people whom wanna help. People are friendly and kind for the most part, and there is progressively released new content for Spiral Knights every so often. Status conditions, and attack types, master your armour and your weapons.\n",
      "Unfortunately for me friends were not included...\n",
      "this a great game to play with friends. really great campaign aswell.\n",
      "A great game with sometimes the funniest games you will ever play. This game has a element of skill that is required but be warned it is not new gamer friendly. Give it some time and you will soon get the hang of it. Watch some helpful guides in the steam community as this will thorougly give you a run down on what to expect or to be expected of.\n",
      "This is a great game and is simply the best! Worth the amount of $20.00  (or $5 on sale) and I would highly recommend it and heres why - Remember, wolf stay of the dance floor! Pros- Can handle many computers, with great fps.- Extremely FUN!- Great game to play with friends and even solo *insert forever alone face*- The game offers many dlc packs and they can be expensive or not worth it but it also supports the devs so try one out?-  Simply the best- It offers you endless heists (with dlc packs) and challenging goals such as becoming infamous and so much more!- It is great, just buy it pls!Cons- Bloody 10gigs (not that much tho)-  Some dlc packs can be expensive and SOMETIMES bad but still good.-  If you have no friends it can be boring, forever alone ;'(- Glitches are annoying- Connection issues (not paydays fault but i'll put it out there)Overall in conclusion I believe this game offers an extreme range of heists and much more the game has great gameplay that are extremely fun! The graphics look incredibly beautiful! The combat / gun combat is incredibly GREAT it is so good!MY OVERALL RATING  9.999999/10 *insert troll face here*\n",
      "Subnautica is a brilliantly made survival and creative game. You will quickly develop a fear for the ocean's depths as you venture further and deeper from the safety of the Safe Shallows. Progress isn't too slow or fast, however you will reach the end game fairly easily depending on how quickly you progress. The end game isn't challenging because of the agressive monsters you meet as you will quickly learn how to counter their attacks (I heard this will change in the near future however), but more so the hours you will spend gathering resources if you are the type of person that loves creating new bases and outposts. There are plently of biomes to explore (Deep Grand Reef and The Mushroom Caves are my favourite). Subnautica is a great singleplayer game but would be even better if you were able to play with friends. I currently have 60 hours in Subnautica but it is bound to rise as I've yet to experience everything this game has to offer! I HIGHLY suggest this game is you are a fan of survival or creative sandbox games as there is currently a lot to do and even more coming in the future.10/10\n",
      "Rust (Legacy) would have to my favorite survival game by far. New rust would be in my top 5 but if you played legacy it doesnt even come close to being as good. Rust is a great game i would highly recommend anyone to get it soak up lots of hours make friends and have a great time.\n",
      "This game is SO much fun! Its WAY better in Co-Op. Me and my friend played this for hours straight and got a huge kick out of it. You should DEF get this game, even more so if you have a friend to play it with. I TOTALLY recommend this game. Get it and  have hours of fun! :D\n",
      "Awesome game that allows creativity to blossom and is great to play with friends.\n",
      "> named a soldier after my girlfriend> go on a mission> girlfriend gets killed> reload mission> repeat 5 times> gg saved girlfriend finally> gg its only the second mission10/10 would save her again\n",
      "This is a fun, relaxing and sometimes stressful game, that puts the player in charge of placing traps, in a tower defence sort of style, to stop an on-coming horde of orcs. It has countless hours of fun and it can even played with another player allowing you to work as a team in keeping these orcs from reaching the end of their path. The weapons and traps can be very brutal and very satisfying. It is also intergrated with the steam workshop allowing you to mod the game for more fun! It is definatly something I'd recomend to everybody but in my opinion, it is best with a friend.\n",
      "Great game if you looking for a fun co-op experience with your friends. Would recomend 10/10\n",
      "10/10 Wish I could go higher great game for you and your friends. Great game to find friends to play online with. Great game for pretty much everything I think I have round 800 or so hours so take that as you may. But definitely worth the money $10 seems like a rip off to valve actually.\n",
      "Almost impossible to play solo, and even with friends you still have to grind for 30 or 40 hours to get the levels you need to build the items so you dont get insta-killed by the clans of 10+ people....\n",
      "This game is fantastic.So when you need to reccomend a game to friends, people always ask about the gameplay and always the graphics, controls and the plot.Gameplay:It's a beat-em-up 2D, which has some details from RPG games. The way the game work is pretty simple, pretty simply awesome!!You have 4 characters to start off with (those shown on the logo, red, green, orange, blue) Each characters have the same skills (attacks) but all have different appearances and magic skills. Such as, the red character is electric, green is poison I think, orange is fire and blue is ice. There are other unlockable characters but these are the main ones. For the abilties to come into place, each character has unlockable magic levels (to level up magic, strength, agility, and defence) the player must gain XP by defeating enemies and once leveling up gets 'points' to spend on those levels. So by leveling up strength your player is more powerful and can unlock more combos, defence the player doesn't have a higher health level but takes less damage from attacks, agility makes the player run faster and makes the bow more badass. The trick is to balance out the things you level up, otherwise you will have a character with too much defense but not powerful enough to kill enemies etc, or a player who cannot use the magic powers for the character he/she is using, which is bad, since the magic in this game is what makes it good too.The game is a great co-op, I played with a friend and there's also other gametypes apart from the storyline arena and stuff, the only problem with the co-op is that it always shows waiting for players because of lag and has to pause the game which is annoying if you're playing with someone with bad internet.Another cool thing is you can play as other characters and level them up, unlock a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of characters by playing arenas + levels + beating the game can unlock a new character.Graphics:They are really nice on this game, I think by default its medium but the games graphics look nice and another thing to note is I haven't had any problems with lag, apart from one level where it lags a bit at one point, but the game runs smooth and yeah, the graphics look nice.Controls:PLAY WITH A PS3/XBOX CONTROLLER!! My PS3 controller, unfourtantely didn't work so I had to use keyboard, I love keyboard but it's so hard to get used to the controls, they didn't even show the correct controls for keyboard just the xbox controller ones so it took a while to figure out what they were + getting used to them but after playing for a few minutes I got used to them. A handy tip is to go on the options menu.Story:I won't ruin anything but the story of the game isn't one of those full on plot ones where the whole game is all about the story, even though all the fights go up to the story but they don't go oh the story here all the time which I enjoyed, but it's a great story.Op:This game is cheap, but gives hours of enjoyment and fun on co-op, I can recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "It's realy fun and addicting game,specialy when u play with friend.lots of mount,allies,and classes u can choose,even its grindy its fun(sorry bad london:))\n",
      "Oddly for me the appeal of this game is that I can play it solo after a day at work and just slowly work my way through levels. L4D did the same thing but I love the melee combat in this one. Definitely more fun and fast paced with friends, so I guess I'm a bit different.\n",
      "This is the only MMORPG i've ever properly enjoyed, the others i've played have got stale within the first week. Archeage is a huge step in the right direction for MMOs it's combat never gets stale and if it does you can just change your class whenever and wherever you want, you never run out of things to do even with the labour system which really helps the games economy from people who would just grind out the same items making them useless which is happened in so many games i've played.Tradepacks are a revolutionary tool and is so perfect for Archeage you use your farmed materials to make them (there is about 4 unique tradepacks per region) i've gone on countless trips across the sea with friends sinking ships killing and dying while delivering these tradepacks for either gilda stars (which you use to purchase plans for ships/vehicles/houses+ a few others) or you can trade it in for gold (i've personally not tried the third hand in) The design of the game is so beautiful every way you look you're amazed by how far you can see and the quality of everything, every new area you enter is like entering a new world new plants and trees grow that you might not have seen before, i'm discovering new trees and so many new areas i've never been now i'm level 50.Every little detail is this game has been looked at and refined perfectly i can't wait for the rest of the Korean version to be ported over, a recent update has also made the game alot smaller to download, and they have also said they won't be forcing us to download huge patches they will be rolled out at around 800mb-1gb which was a big problem for me when i played WoW! If you do choose to buy or wait untill archeage is released for f2p as soon as you jump on you'll wish you had it sooner this it the best game i have EVER played full stop i highly recommend the Archeum pack to jump into the Alpha with us all now :) Purchase some land and breed your polar bears for an awesome polar bear mount! what more do you want?? a black one? well they have it! Don't get me started about the naval side of things it's INCREDIBLE from the water to your ship to the mightiest Galleon you'll never get bored with this game.\n",
      "This is a zombies review.I will review each map separately and then review all of them as one.Kino Der Toten 7.5/10-----------------------This map is quite easy but a very classical map with one of the best training spots at the stage not a very hard map due to dog rounds and the most overpowered Wonderweapon the ThunderGun. Overall a enjoyable map which is good for new players to learn how to train and sustain points with interesting art.Five 6/10----------This map is extremely hard. Due to there only being one training spot in this map which is expensive to get to and to make it work well you need to buy 2 doors or so. The boss is also painful to deal with as he can take away your gun but if you kill it you receive a Bonfire sale. The Winter's Howl is a bad Wonderweapon which effects the map. Overall the map is good with friends due to a fun camping spot in the elevators but solo it is hard to get to high rounds due to there only being one training spot.Ascension 8/10----------------This map is pretty sick. With the first kind of new way to receive pack a punch launching the three flight pads. The map was pretty easy due to the fact that you could train anywhere pretty well and having the Thunder gun, though it had hard elements of it such as the monkeys forcing you if playing solo to only really having 2 perks or so cause they would just steal them. Overall a great map to get extremely high rounds and enjoyable with friends.Call of the dead 7/10----------------------Ok call of the dead is very different to all maps. It starts off having fog which is a pain and dealing with the boss of the map George. This fellow gets in your way and if you attack him or are attacked by him he gains enrage and runs super fast and attacks you but calm-able by taking him to the water. The Wonderweapons are great the Scavenger is a great explosive weapon but PHD is needed or becomes useless and will kill you. The VR-11 Is good to take out George but making him calm and turns a zombie into a human like a moving monkey bomb. The map is good with a decent training spot and enjoyable oh though has annoying features like George and how far jug and the power is from spawn. Overall a good map and worth playing.Shangri-La 4/10-----------------Ok ok this map is a very hard and badly made map. Due to it being so close quartered there is no real good training spots but the fact you have the Baby maker does make it some how survival-able cause its a great weapon. The map itself looks amazing with cool looking textures and a amazing atmosphere with it being all tropical. Overall the fact the map brought cool new stuff like the water and new zombies it makes it enjoyable but it is unlikely to get to a high round on.Moon 3.5/10--------------Moon is one of those maps you really enjoy or dislike. For me its dislike I love the theme of the moon but the fact low gravity really does mess with you as you can bounce back into your train is annoying as hell. This map has a sick Easter egg blowing up the earth and empowering the Aether to Richthofen. The map has a nice feel to it but is annoying spawning on earth then going to the moon and how you have to do this 2 times to get jug unless your a skilled player. A map for people that are better at zombies but still pretty bad due to it being annoying hard to get basics.In the end buying black ops one is a good idea but do buy with all the maps. Its much harder then black ops 2 due to maps just being made worse and harder mainly cause training in most of these maps can be quite a challenge. Overall the game is 36/60 which is worth a buy.\n",
      "Reviewing each episode individually then the game as a hole--------------------------------------SPOILERS AHEAD PLUS THE FACT THAT THIS REVIEW WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE CHOICES I MADE.--------------------------------------SEASON 1Episode 1. 8/10----------------One was definitely my favourite episode. With the introducement to the main characters Jesse, Axel Olivia and Lucas. This sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the 'Order Of The Stone' in which the victor gets to meet Gabriel the warrior one of the members of the Order. After all of this crap happens you lose your pig and gotta find him meeting Petra the female feminist empowering character. You and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist Ivory or as I call him 'The Shady Guy'. After the interview with Gabriel, Ivory builds a Wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy Axel and the witherstorm gones ape S**t and starts consuming endercon completey. After a chain of events in which you can save Petra or Galbriel you enter the nether after this you find yourself at the Order's temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet Galbriel gave you, oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order. You have to choose to go with Olivia to find Ellegard or with Axel to find Magnus. A great fun episode.Episode 2 6/10-----------In this episode you have to choices I went with Olivia so I will tell the story of Ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips s**t up yet again. After you return you find Galbriel just chillin in the temple with Lucas. Also Axel went to find the other dude. After this you find the tracker to my boy Soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple, The two Order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into Ivory in which you find out he was a former Order member, you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library. This was an ok episode probs oh though I still reckon it was the worst out of the four.Episode 3 7.5/10-----------In this episode you attempt to find Soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the End. In there you find a whole wool world Sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build. After putting the enderman suit on you try to find him, after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house. There the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape. After coming back to surface you make the Super TNT Crap and Magnus and Ellegard are back together fighting the Witherstorm. There you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either Ellegard or Magnus. Getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them. Finding either Petra or Galbriel you run away into the next episode. This was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of time.Episode 4 8/10-----------In this episode you run away from the Witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that Petra has forgotten everything and doesn't remember you. In which you try to figure out stuff about the Witherstorm. Ivory comes along and Soren gets hell mad that the bomb didn't work but Ivory figures out to destroy it using a Enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the 'Far Lands.' when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to Ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the Order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the Witherstorm. After leaving you finally engage the Witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig Reuben dies. After Galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new 'Order of the stone.' In the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or \"Let the people dream.\" This episode was sick finally ending the Witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become Legendary.Overall Minecraft story-mode is really fun game with unique character creation semi-predicatable and for a so called 'kids game' actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation, though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish it's still a really funny sick game defiantly  worth buying. 7.5/10 (LETS SAY 1-4 IS SEASON 1 REGARDLESS AS IT ALL LINKS TOGETHER.)SEASON 2---- (Will review when all episodes come out.)==\n",
      "I love this game.Would recommend it to all my friends.\n",
      "Great Game, Classic Vehicle Combat (Tanks or Jets) mixed with Minecraft (Build whatever you want), Robocraft is born. Creative, Fun and most importantly, for Free. Play with friends or against them to see who is the best player out there.\n",
      "I got this game in the steam sale. Bought it for all my friends. No one did the tutorial and everyone jumped straight into a Free for All PvP. Discovered the strategic missile, nuked everyone before any of us knew how to counter it.10/10\n",
      "This game, after buying the 2 pack and giving the other to my best friend and playing it for 15 mins, is seriously amazing. Awesome art, music and great, great gameplay. I strongly recommend it as the gameplay provides for awesome either 30 second fights or eternal fights. The amount of sneaky, freind ship ruining tricks just makes it an unforgetable experience. 11/10 - would pay $30 for\n",
      "Ah, Planetside 2. One of my favourite games of all time. Despite the fact Steam says I've played 110 hours or so, I first played the game from the SOE website, and I got maybe 250 hours from that, so I've played  roughly 360 hours of Planetside 2.After racking up this much time in game, I thought it neccessary to write a review. First comes the crucial first minutes. Back then the tutorial was unheard of, so you were thrown head first into combat with no more than a pat on the back and a thumbs up. I dropped in and ran for cover.Within seconds I was being shot at. I joined up with a squad and eventually got the hang of the game. I quite quickly began to understand the controls so it wasn't as rough as it is on some other players.After purchasing a few new weapons and practising, I was right in battle with the best of them. I also met some really good friends who I still jump in with to this day.All in all, quite an entertaining experience. Now we move on to the pros and cons.Pros:+Fast paced yet tacticle combat+Variety+Friendly yet competetive community+\"Fair\" for new players+Literal hours and hours of fun+Not play to win or play to playCons:-Steep learning curve-Difficult for new players to get the hang of (prepare to die over and over)-Very straining on computersIt could sound quite biased and I know there are things I'll have missed but I still think PS2 is a great game for everyone, be you a fan of FPS games or not18.7/10\n",
      "I truly love this game, I can finally play this game ! But then suddenly 1 day I can't play anymore .Everytime I wanna play competitive, it loads and then stuck at the get ready in 5,4,3,2,1 . Then my game crash for no reason , hope valve can fix this problem pls ASAP, because i pay for this game and it would b really suck if i have this kind of results . I reinstall it alot of times it just never works. Valve please help me fix this problem I really want to play cs:go with my friends and it sucks to be left out\n",
      "Bought for Survival..Stayed for Battle Royale.Fun to do stuff in Battle Royale, Survival Mode was to easy. after 2 days of playing, i had a full base and 3 cars and a bunch of guns. Hadn't died. Wasn't hard enough. Got bored after that!Would recommend for people who like the Battle Royale, about 240 hours of my hours atm 250 are Battle Royale. Could play it all night with friends!\n",
      "This was the reason that I got steam in 2011, as a friend had wanted to gift this to me.I now have over 200 hours with the New Steam Version included, and after 8 years of this game being out, it is still amazing.The mod support has extended the life of this game so much, even without the ability for Steam Workshop, which CoH 2 has. The mods available are varied enough to give everyone something they like, with different maps or game modes included in most of the large total conversion mods such as Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front.The base game itself is also extremely fun and very user friendly; it doesn't take long to get the hang of the game, and you can use the very enjoyable campaign as a running tutorial before getting into the multiplayer, which is still populated by the die hard fans.The expansions are also well worth the price of admission if you're a fan of the game, especially now that they are at such low prices, having been out for quite a while.This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played, and one of the best ever made, RTS or otherwise, and it's well worth buying.\n",
      "Our friend killed us all....What a traitor.....#BlameKaya\n",
      "Play this game for an hour, you say? That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You know you wasted centuries on gettting absolutely destroyed by Gandhi and friends when you decided to make peace and shizz. Self-defence is truly frowned upon by those pacifists.\n",
      "Dickbeater69: *Types in (Is this it for us) erases it and changes to (How's the weather been there recently).Emerly35: It's been alright.Dickbeater69: Only options left are (Goodbye) *Says Goodbye*Game ends.10/10 best option choosing simulator would get friendzoned again.P.S ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ guy named Brad, he stealing my hoes and ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ him.\n",
      "Top reasons to like: A new story and is somewhat fun. This game feels really likeable and re uses the models from Halo Wars. The enemies know how to play as far as AIs go.  Also most (will  clarify in cons) feel fair and fun to use. If your up for a challenge, replayability is good too.Cons: It doesnt have the features of the xbox one version (add them now developers and not as dlc). i really would like to do the co op with friends. You can also \"buy\" into the campaign with premium weapons that are insanely overpowered. A 400 shot auto rocket launcher..... really ._. .\n",
      "What do you mean this game is only fun with friends? Who do you think I am to have a friends list full of people that want to play games with me? What am I a famous youtuber?But really the game is alright. It runs well and gets updated quite a bit. My only problem is its gets boring after playing it for like 30 minutes even with friends. But other then that its not a bad game even for its price. I can't say if you should or shouldn't buy it, its your choice. I'm just going to vote yes to recommend this game but I mostly stand neutral on this game.\n",
      "Gameplay : 8/10 - Fast paced, first person shooter with many choices of guns and equipment, also community-made games such as Saxton Hale and Dodgeball which hooked me for hours. Including 100s of community made maps and such. However includes small aspects of teamwork which makes the game interestingCommunity: 7/10 - 20% of the people you will find are 7 year-olds who constantly brag about making boom-boom with my mum. However the other 70% of people you will find are wonderful people and great friends, constantly being friendly and showing newer players aspects of the game. The other 10% are ♥♥♥♥♥ :)Graphics : 7/10 - Customisable towards liking, however the highest setting results in a mediocre style look, however plausible with the cartoonish feel towards the gameStory: 8/10 - Good lore behind the characters once you investigate, including various comics which show the backstory towards characters, I also love the Meet The Class videos, which you can find on youtube, where you can find out the true personality on the charactersControls 10/10 - Fully customisable, which make the game user friendlyOverall - 8.5/10\n",
      "Great game... but best played with friends\n",
      "Great game for you and your friends 8/10\n",
      "Good game albiet a tad short (Granted still in beta)Very familiar setting for those who have played terraria, Mod friendly, and still plenty of more features coming, for 15 bucks it's not that bad.\n",
      "Well........Really cool game!This is a good game that  is fun alone and with friends!Not much else to say execpt umm........ITS FREE AND ONLY 33MB JUST DOWNLOAD IT! WHY ARE YOU READING THE REVIEWS ON SUCH A GOOD GAME.yeah thats it.\n",
      "NOTE: This copy was given to me by the developer for review purposes, this however does not change the review in anyway.OverviewHuman: Fall Flat is an amusing and puzzling game, with character physics, you could compare to 'Gang Beasts'. The aim is to try and escape a floating island, by finding the exit door, but don't try cheat by fall off the edge, as that will get you back where you started!QualityGraphics | The graphics implemented in the game are geometrically exquisite, with each having its own specific theme, and objects to match the theme.Audio | Human: Fall Flat features a range of peaceful, instrumental music, allowing you to think while trying to find a solution to the problems at hand.Gameplay | Human: Fall Flat is exceptionally well made. I personally love the concept of how the developers added some humour to the game, even though it's a puzzle game (which aren't usually made with a silly factor in mind) they decided to add in a \"act dead\" move, which I found to have absolutely no use in the game! XD But it was good to see that the developers added it anyways, for recording and other things you see you tubers put on their channels, who knows how creative someone might be with it! :)Pros & ConsPros:• Split Screen | The game allows you to play local split screen, which allows you complete levels with a friend, making it more enjoyable, and also makes the game easier as some levels are hard without a helping hand.• Customisation | The game allows you to paint your own character instead of giving you presets or one single character preset to stick with, this allows you to customise Bob towards your own liking.• Tutorials | The game gives these little remotes out during the game that help you if you get stuck on a certain part, and give you tips and tricks that will help you throughout the game.• Multiple Ways | The game allows multiple ways for the problem to be solved, and you aren't just forced onto a specific path.• Simple Controls | The game controls are simple to learn and not that long to get used to, making fun and easy gameplay.Cons:• Bugs | On very rare a occasions, I have ran into a certain bug, when starting up the game, and during the part where you fall through the trapdoor, the man decides to hold on, and the only way to fix was to restart, but it continues to happen like every now and then. ConclusionHuman: Fall Flat is a great game, for a price of $15 dollars it seems to live up to its worth, but there's still a lot of potential left for the game, like introducing a storyline or some sort of online play. Hopefully the game updates over time, with more levels, high difficulty as they come!9/10 For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here! \n",
      "NOTE: This copy was given to me by the developer for review purposes, this however does not change the review in anyway.OverviewFortified is a fun, defensive and strategic game which is based in the 1950s. The story is that Martians come to Earth, with people thinking they came in peace, until the Martians attack a year later. This causes the American Army to gather a team of heroes to fight them off.  You're mission is to choose one of the heroes to fight off the Martian scum, utilising that heroe's personal weapons, buildings and abilities. Beware though, level progress is saved to the hero that completed those levels and that it can't be transferred to other heroes.QualityGraphics - The graphics in Fortified are exquisite and of top quality for an indie game. The game combines both a 2D and 3D version of the characters and background by using a comic strip for the story and the 3D mode for the game. Audio - The Soundtrack and sounds add some intensity to the game by having songs with a creepy tone and feel to it. It will help the game get on your nerves when playing on that high on level in intensity difficulty. Gameplay - The game itself is very smooth. I'm personally impressed with the fact they had a \"shift to run\" button, making it easier to get from side to side on bigger maps with more Martian spawn points and rockets to protect. I'm also happy with the type of heroes that are available and they are all unique in a way. They could probably do some more development on the story as it is not too clear and they could add some more info on who the heroes are.Pros & ConsPros:•\tComical Art Style | The way they used the comic strip type of art for the storyline was very nice and really did resemble an old comic from the 1950s. This gives more of a feel that the developers really put time into this game and thought about all the details.•\tMusic | The music in the game adds to the nerve of the game as said before, this is a good thing. They have a few different tracks that tradition into each other making sure it isn't too repetitive.•\tGameplay and Price | For a price of $14.99 this game packs quite a punch! The game lasts around 4-6 hours, maybe even a few more with the multiplayer and achievements.•\tAchievements and Cards | There are quite a few achievements to unlock, which is a great compared to most indie games, which usually come with 5 achievements or less. The game also comes with cards so that you can get some cash back for the game, or so you can make the awesome badge!Cons:•\tFriendly AI | There is currently no availability for you to add in extra AI heroes in either Singleplayer or Multiplayer. This means that the only way to complete levels is in single player on your own, with a friend or with a complete stranger on matchmaking, which cannot always be possible due timezones, ping and availability.Suggestions•\tMake a Comic/ Animation | This would be a great add-on to expand the story a bit more, showing the mysteries of the heroes and how they came about. The game already has the Art Style, just needs the story. :)•\tInvader Mode | It would be cool to have a mode where you send in the enemies at your command instead of the enemies coming in the same pattern every time. It would probably be good for multiplayer, I don't know, it's just an idea, hope you take these ideas into consideration! :DConclusionFinishing up, Fortified is a really good game both a TD game and 3rd Person shooter. The game exceed my exceptions of a good indie game, but it could have some more features that people usually expect in such a game, such as Friendly AI or First Person Mode, other than that this game should exceed and should stay active for a long time! 9/10^^My rating (will change if they make a difference in future updates.)

      "Saints Row: The Third is not a game that you would expect to play, if you have either played any previous games in the series or played GTA and think of giving this series a shot, then you will be in for a big suprise because this game is unique in many ways.What makes this particular instalment unique to the previous games in the series is the location of the game, in the previous instalments you were in the city of Stilwater, in this game you are placed in the city of Steelport. With better graphics, new weapons and a nicer and easier interface to use, this game is truely a treat to get instead of of it's predecessors.Some bad things about this game are that it's graphics are now outdated compared to it's successors and that you can only play co-op multiplayer (only 2 players), so you can't play a giant rampage with 3 or more friends.In my final opinion, this is a fun and great game to play and have, especially if you have played any previous games in the series, even if you finished the game you can still play around with the game for as long as you want!This review was made with the help of my good friend \"MCZ - 1989\"\n",
      "its very entertaining for hundreds of hours especially with friends\n",
      "I got this game upon many recommendations from friends and collieages and so far, I am impressed with just how great a game it is. I now plan on spending quite a lot of time playing this game.\n",
      "Well Rust is quite a good game besides the fact it's in early access. The guns are not extremely over powered because of their kick is very high as it would be in real life but you would still loose hand rock vs pistol. I like how The developers are taking a new lead to this game and have been doing alot of updates and changes lately but one thing that I haven't seen in the devblog is a way on how to make the player base more friendly. This is a big deal with gameplay in Rust because it is extremely hard to find someone who doesn't shoot you on sight ( Even If your a new spawn with no gear sometimes.) This is getting to a ridiculous point it has turned a survival game to an all out free for all where people shoot on sight. now a days the only way I find someone who doesn't shoot on sight is when I have a better weapon than them and I tell them to run off and maybe give them food. but sometimes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ urge is to strong in some people and they go for the kill anyways. The only benefit from this player base is killing a bandit who killed you as a new spawn and absolutly burn their soul in embarrasment. Maybe the devs can't fix this but we can I and my friends have made a pledge not to shoot on sight unless we know that person is hostile. can you guys please band together on this one for me it would make the gameplay alot better. At Rust's Current state I give it a 7/10 The player base needs alot of work!\n",
      "(if you cant be bothered reading this then just scroll down for the rating and reasons on why it's good and bad)It's a really good game considering its price however it does take a week to get used to the controls and how some of the gamemodes work in it but they don't have a tutorial... It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).\n",
      "its really brutal and hard to get started with but when you learn a character and how to deal with each enemy and boss you can be unbeatable and is so fun with friends off or online ive played around 6 hours more offline and even after all that my best is last level at 70 MINITUES which is just the equvelent of DEATH\n",
      "Don't Starve Together is an interesting game. It's an \"uncomprimising game full of science and magic\" according to the game's site, and I would agree. It's an interesting little survival game in an interesting little world. A survival game may turn off many, but I would argue that it's quite an interesting game. Or well, that was the last game. This game adds multiplayer, which in my opinion, is an absolutely genius idea. The original game, Don't Starve, turned me off after a couple hours of playing. Don't Starve Together, with the addition of multiplayer, makes the game much easier to enjoy. I also really love its sadistic art style.Bringing the game down is its aforementioned boringness (yeah, even with friends).I would recommend Don't Starve Together only to those who would like a nice survival challenge, just don't go in thinking the game'll be your new Team Fortress 2.I wouldn't recommend this game to the completionist crowd, however, as completing this game will leave you with a certain emptiness.Final Rating: 7.0/10\n",
      "Great game for pretty much anyone but especially if you have a creative mind or a bunch of friends to play with.\n",
      "If enough time invested into this game and effort, even if you don't do great damage it's really fun to stick around town and talk with friends with a unique and nice looking character. Even though this game may be dead as hell at the moment it's still playable!\n",
      "Garry's Mod? Where should I start with Garry's mod...1. Buy it2. Buy it3. Buy it for a friend4. Watch your life fade away into the hands of Garrys Mod.\n",

      "Amazing, addictive, great fun with friends and amazingly cheap\n",
      "This game is worse than my chance of getting a girlfriend.\n",
      "I like this game, its a chilled back game where you can build a skyscraper. It is fun too play when talking too friends so you dont get bored or play on your ipad while waiting (I suggest hearthstone :P), I like this game, its a bit confusing at first but after a while you start too understand how to build stuiff correctly, there isnt really anything with replayability though, its pretty much the same each time.\n",
      "IT NEEDS MORE WORK -----------------------ITS FUN When you play with friends When i Have items full of chemicals rocks metal i cant make anything whats the point of this crafting system i gotta say that crafting looks cool but i have to find recipe so i can craft that IT IS SOO BULLSHET SO I HAVE TO GOAROUND AND FIND RECIPE YOUR MAKING US TRY FINDING THE RECIPE AND PLAY FOR IT IF YOU REMOVE IT THE GAME WOULD BE MORE FUN AND IT WOULD BE MORE ENTERTAINING WHEN I SEE THAT I HAVE TO FIND A RECIPE AND CRAFT IT IM LIKE DAM ITS ONE OF THESE GAMES  REMOVE RECIPE TO MAKE IT FUN\n",

      "The forest is a Great survival game.Im not joking this game is amazing and i love it.There is also mutliplayer i reccomand to play mutliplayer with friends.This game scary very scary and there is some photos,magazines and timmys drawings.The only thing i want to know is that will there be a ending.do you get timmy back or is he dead.\n",
      "Borderlands 2 has the best co-op fps experience I have witnesed in a long time. I would recomend this to anyone who is into fps games and wants to have an exciting time with thire friends in this steampunk, open word adveture.\n",
      "I personally am not a fan of the civilisation series but If you have some friends over skype, It can still be quite fun once you get to know the basics.\n",
      "good for the price of it gives some good fun and it has multiplayer im gonna be playing with my friendsafordable and funwhat else do you wan't\n",
      "Muuuito bom, jogo mto completo, otimo para jogar com amigos!(Very good, very complete game, perfect to play with friends!)\n",
      "The gameplay is great i love it but nothing else works. The matchmaking is ♥♥♥♥, Uplay is ♥♥♥♥, I should not need to reconfigure my router to be able to play with my friends, this game is not worth $60 but you can get it for less on other websites which i am under the belief i cannot mention without the names getting censored by steam. For a triple A game it should not have nearly as many problems as it does have. However i am completely hooked at the moment and have sunk a good amount of hours into this game and i am still having fun, if you do buy this be ready to bear the agony and frustration that this game brings.\n",
      "This game is fun with friends and has alot of maps it has the workshop and its really fun.\n",

      "This is the best open-world survial games every to be released its just one of the best games to be released even though its still in early access and its got some game breaking bugs its so amazing and fun escpically with friends and they add new things constantly so you always got a new thing to try and do. The best.\n",
      "This gaming was incredible. I would rate this one of my all time favorite games. It was so good and everything about it was so fluid. I would and have reccommended this game to a lot of my friends. Not once have I ever thought this game sucks, it was too good for that. I am extremely happy with this game and would rate it a 9.5/10. The .5 was that the second building curse sucked, and the game was a bit too quick. None the less, it was worth the money 100%. A good price for a good game with lots of replay value.\n",
      "Easily one of the best survival games out there. There is a few bugs a glitches still left but for an early access game it\\'s still pretty good.Things you can do:Chop treesNearly die or actually die when your mate chops down a tree and it hits youRealise that a cannibal has been stalking you for ages, then you either run away or chase him/herSAGGY ♥♥♥♥!Eat berries and mushrooms that either kill you or make you high... mostly kill youHide like a baby in a treehouse when night comes because you cant sleep anymore and have to wait :/Explore caves with your mates = Finds dynamite = Friends use dynamite and throw it at you = It explodes killing you bothOnce you spawn with you friends, you find the axe then try to kill each other even though its a co-op gameBuild a ♥♥♥♥ load of traps thats just overkill that surrounds your base and the cannibals cant touch the first outta wallThere is heaps of things to do in this game if you have the imagination, and a mate who likes to be a ♥♥♥♥ :D.I highly recommend this game to anyone you is looking for a good decent survival game thats still being updated.\n",
      "I played the game in beta before the actual release of the game and that was pretty fun, a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs and everything but who really cares, it was beta and it kinda made it more fun and hilarious when playing with friends. Then when the full game was released, i was so excited for it, because in beta you could only play as one of the killers (the trapper). So when i hoped in my very first lobby, people were leaving, then joining, then leaving again. My first thought was that they just wanted to play with their friends, but then another answer poped in my head, they were just disconecting from the server and returning to the main menu because thats what happened to me. Then when i joined and actually played, the killer was a wraith, so i thought \"ah ok, i'll just play\" but no, the wraith is too OP, they kinda really need to nerf the wraith killer, but overall, when you get a killer who doesn't hook camp, or over abuse the wraith skill, then the game is pretty fun. Also, my opinion is that i have seen some people say that the game would be alot better with a \"invite a friend to a public lobby\" thing. Well i completely disagree with that, because this game is based around working as a team without people asking for it, if someone is on a hook, its common instinct to help them... But yes you will get those people who will only care about escaping and getting the generators rathing than helping a fallen survivor, but hey, in every game you play you are gonna encounter a few of these people, i guess for me its exciting just to see what kind of teamates you get and what type the killer is.I recommend this game, but if you are one of those impatiant, \"i want everything now\" people, well then this probably isnt this kind of game for you at this present point in time.8/10: Keep up the good work devsAlso remember people, this game not long came out, so gives the devs a break and let them do what they need to do, rather than asking for everything right of the bat.\n",
      "SAVE THE KING!This is one of my favourite LAN party games. It's easy to get into and has dark humour.If you enjoy pouring boiling oil on your friends and see them scream in agony as a trebuchet throws them across the map then this is the game for you.Highly recommended.\n",
      "Awesome game! A few people who kos but u can always get ur revenge :)A lot survival tatics and also fun with friends!\n",
      "I was going through a rough time in my life. My parents were fighting constantly, I had no friends, and everyone I met hated me because I was fat. I needed something to prevent me from suicide. I could not find anything I really liked. I tried buying toys, but the store clerks always prevented me from buying anything because I was overweight. I tried making a vlog on YouTube about my troubles, but I was banned from youtube for supposedly impersonating Gabriel Iglesias. Google fined me all of my money until I only had $10 left.The only things I had were things necessary for my survival. I was fed a potato every other day and also given water in a shot glass. Sometimes I forced myself to use the water as a way to bath instead of drinking it. I was locked in my room every day cuz my parents were busy fighting about which console to play on. Well, not entirely.I had this netbook, one my parents got me for my birthday when I was 12. I used it for school, mostly, until now. I was also lucky enough to have a charger, and all the stuff you need to use the netbook. I decided, maybe give video games a try. No one would judge me there. I was unable to play the f2p games because A. They took too much storage and B. I would be banned whenever I joined a multiplayer game. I remembered the $10 I had left.I knew I had to find something that gave me a reason to live. I looked through the steam store. Jesus almost nothing was $9.99! I was about to give up and just end my life when I found this game. Ratz Instagib. $9.99, without 10% tax. It took up all the space on my netbook. After waiting for it to download, I opened up the game. Upon opening it up there was a well made launcher with many options. Once I opened up the actual game, I heard a sweet jazz song, and saw some badass looking ratz and a cool map. Was this what I needed to continue livingIt was. I am proud to say Ratz Instagib saved my life. The characters were deep, had personality, and I was able to connect with them. The story was unique, suspenseful, and I shed multiple tears. The graphics were revolutionary, and the soundtrack was the first good thing I had heard in awhile. It, in a way, provided everything I needed to live. The characters were my friends. The game was like a good parent. The game was easy to fap to. I could have just played the game for my entire life. It was amazing. It changed me. Here I am, sitting in my room, now infested with bullet ants and bees, starved half to death and with my throat about to dry up. But you know what? I do not care. Because I have Ratz Instagib. And I will always have Ratz Instagib. This game is my life now. I am finally happy. I am finally free. I know now the meaning of life. And only because  Lino Slahuschek games spent their time on this godly game.\n",
      "Actually a pretty fun game when you play with a friend, Its cheap and worth it!\n",
      "Don't take my on steam time play time as my experience with this game. I've been playing this game for years and have easily racked up 100+ Hours on it. This is a fantastic game with one of the best skill-tree desgined leveling systems I have ever seen!The story is nothing new, you're a hero of Greece off to save the world from various Gods and Demons, your usual Greek Mythos RPG but that's not the strong part of this game! This game's strong points come from, as I've already mentioned, it's skill trees - they're simply top notch.The game has no focus on PvP and with that they could focus on making some spells fantastical and simply, if the game was to have PvP, overpowered but because there is no PvP it's all fine and dandy. And even though your powers are mighty, that doesn't mean this game is easy! There are certain sections that can easily kick your ♥♥♥, especially on the higher difficulties.ALTHOUGH not all is well. If you plan on purchasing this stellar game for it's Co-Op I have sad news for you - Gamespy has recently closed it's servers for this game and it no longer supports INTERNET play (I have yet to test it's LAN functionality) and Himachi seems unable to fix this so far! So take heed if you plan on playing with friends over the net, at this moment (to my knowledge) there is no way to do so. However this game still is great as a single player experience. If you're a lover of games like Diablo this is certainly a game for you and definitely worth even it's non-sale $15 price tag.\n",
      "I plan to write a decent rendition of why I think this is the best 4x game I have played however for now I will just say this:Nothing gives you more of an adrenaline rush than playing a long ironman game and having to fight a massive multi-participant battle over your own homeworld as it is bombed by xenos hell bent on your annihilation with your fleets lacking a tech edge or numbers. Try not to shed a tear for your little virtual peeps as they migrate, make friends, do science and fight to the death all under your direction. Will you be a happy little camper in your own little corner of the galaxy or will you risk it all to bring all empires into the fold of you obviously better empire?I found Earth, destroyed by nuclear warfare. I uplifted cockroaches and allowed them to own an entire sector. After a grueling war they saved my economy. Due to their immense help and the help of my other alien races within the UCSS I gave all alien citizens the right to vote and run for any office.Several years later a Cockroach general was on the ground when I defeated the armies on two of my long time rival homeworlds.Nellpa'xo and it's many allies started the war with me because the UCSS was making their hippy vibes feel bad. Not even kidding they are space bug Ghandi from Civ. 3 wars with there alliance! One loss (The UCSS had to give up multiple worlds), one white peace (we destroyed much of each other's fleets) and finally victory. Never give up, never surrender and fight!If you haven't bought this and you like being immersed in games, I highly, highly recommend you buy this.TL;DR: I press F to pay respects to the 1st Chosen fleet that saved my homeworld and was wiped out as it lured away several empires worth of enemy fleets.\n",
      "An Anime-stlyed mmorpg, point and click style.Be what you want and do what you want.While I may not have many hours here on steam, I mainly played the game prior to having it on steam.I would recommend this game to any of my friends, and if Tarlach server is joined - then I'll be willing to help people out.Mabinogi is an MMORPG, with the following unique features:- CombatNow, you may think \"Combat, every game has that\".While this is true, Mabinogi incorporates many forms of combat, such as:* Martial Arts* Ninja Skills* Magic* Alchemy* Puppeteer* Melee* Range* Gunslinger* Lancer / Knight* and more!!- QuestsThe Quests is Mabinogi vary from doing something as simple as gathering items, to something as crafty as making an item. They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the \"Housing\" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The \"Homestead\" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing\"Rebirth\" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your \"combat\" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme? Done.If you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.Server: TarlachMy in-game name: Alyxa\n",

      "Ive bought this game when there was a sale of 15% off a year ago, expecting that the full game will come soon at that time. and a year after i bought that game, the full game is not yet out...I recommend this game to my friends, if only we could play... but its still a overall fun game to play with when your bored and you want to beat the living crap out of someone and this is the game to play, i just hope that the bot had an Ai so that it could fight back to make things more interesting.Still waiting on the full game...\n",
      "CS:GO is a really fun game to play with friends, with the competetive and the casual gameplay makes an outstanding gameplay, not to mension the graphics of the game are outstanding, keep up the good work valve for the up coming skins and updates, thanks for an awesome game\n",
      "Undertale is a great game, when i first saw people playing this on youtube i thought looks good but still not gonna get it, then i saw a couple of my steam friends playing it, I asked them how the game was and they all up gave the same answer but not the same way, then i went a got the game for my self and all i can say is, the characters are charming the story is great and the best part for me is Sans, with his puns, they keep tickles my funny bone.\n",

So basically we were in the same party and we somehow we got seperated and couldn't join the same game. Would love to review some of the gameplay but this is as far as we got before we switched back to having more fun playing TF2. Has amazing potential, but i honestly don't think it will get to the same stage as the games alike i.e. TF2\n",
      "T-Boned a car, whilst going 323km/h down a road, launching it vertically 20 meters in the air and 30 meters down the road.Respawned from the crash, car is still in the air10/10 would Crash againEdited Proper Review as of 11/12/2014.Warning 'The Crew' is not a Simulation racing game, it is an ARCADE Racer.if you are looking for a decently fun racing game to play. 'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this.There are few issues however with the game such as.The Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).Warning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) .  These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.This being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc If you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.If any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )\n",

      "I actually find it rather difficult to recommend this game, even though it is one of my favourite games ever.And the reason why is the same thing you will hear in all of the serious reviews of the game. It lacks any significant depth.Let me start with the positives.    -The ships are amazing to fly. They all feel different and sound different, as well as look different and perform different.    -Combat is fun and balanced. It requires skills and patience, and is quite rewarding particularly when you manage to take down a larger ship.    -The sound design is absolutely amazing. Each ship sounds unique and all of the sound effects are absolutely superb.    -The game features an insanely in depth background simulation. In each of the hundreds of thousands of inhabited systems, numerous factions each have their own laws, affiliations and influence. A supply and demand based economy allows for dynamic variations in profitability, based on both the background simulation and player actions.    -The game has some of the best community involvement I've ever witnessed. Players influencing the economy has been a feature of many games, but in Elite the devs allow for player created lore-friendly news articles. Player created lore-friendly factions and political gameplay. Player run initiatives, and community goals which can be started and run by players. Elite has community involvement which legitimately shapes the galaxy around how the players act, and it really makes for some amazing opportunities.    -The game is beautiful and well optimised. I'm running it on a 6 year old laptop with a broken fan and I get smooth fps in almost every situation(excluding some planetary landings with Horizons)    -The game has a lot of freedom. Pretty much the only restriction that will limit what you can do will be your in game credits. Almost everything is available right from the start.This game also has a lot of negatives, however:    -To quote a video game reviewer Yahtzee-\"A game where the player can do anything is a game that focusses on nothing.\" Elite lacks depth. The trading mechanics are lackluster and basic. The combat, although fun, lacks much significant purpose and become very repetitive. Exploration is also something that gets quite repetitive quite quickly, and the way that the mechanics repeat themselves just ends up boring a lot of people.    -Missions are worthless and in some cases, broken. This is going to be fixed with Horizons patch 2.1 hopefully, but as it stands missions often do little to increase someone's balance.    -The game is horrifically bad at explaining almost all of the mechanics. The first tutorial essentially tells you that left click = fire weapons and then ends. I have had this game for many months now and I am still learning about how some of the most basic mechanics actually work, and that was because I have done a lot of research into how to do things in the game.Overall, I personally love Elite Dangerous, but many people find that it is boring or much too difficult or unfinished. And I think these claims are justified. I would say that it takes a certain type of person to enjoy Elite, particularly in its current state. If you are the type of person who is able to self motivate yourself to participate in the galaxy as if you were actually living in it then I absolutely must recommend this game. If you are the type of person who wants a game for casual fun, then I don't recommend buying the full game, perhaps just buy Arena instead.\n",

      "So far from what i have played of Killing Floor 2 i can say that the beta is amazing and i havent found anybugs and only minor annoyences.The gun play so far is nice and polised and fun with the exception of a few balancing issues here and there but those will get ironed out eventuly and the perks all feel and play diffrently and in turn makes you feel more like a part of a bigger team overall and so far all my online experiences have been good and the comunity is nice and friendly from what i have seen.My only complaint so far is the lack of content within the game but it is still in beta so more content will be comming out eventuly. But for now i can safely say that Killing Floor 2 is an amazing so far and has a bright future\n",

      "The guys at Gearbox have an amazing sense of humour and pepper this game with plenty of pop culture references and easter eggs. Play this with at least one friend for maximum enjoyment. I'm a huge fan of co-op shooters like this, and I really wish there were more of them as a whole, but if they're also made as well as this game, I'll be a happy camper indeed. Great fun, lots of replayability, worth it.\n",
      "Mass Effect is one of those games where you'll like it or you won't. I have friends who can't stand it even though they've never played it, simply because they find the whole concept of being able to pursue relationships with the NPCs as ridiculous. You don't, however, even need to embrace this part of the gameplay to complete the game, nor does it effect your experience. Ultimately all you'll miss out on is flirty conversations and a cut-scene or two.Besides, in the first game you can't romance Garrus and we all know you want a piece of that Vakarian ♥♥♥.Mass Effect allows you to take various approaches in combat. You can spec your Shepard in three fields: psychic powers, tech gadgets or the standard point-and-shoot gun toter. I started out purely as a grunt, but gradually began dual-speccing into the psychic tree because there are definitely scenarios where the powers come in handy with the management of hostile AI.The game also follows the 'good' vs 'evil' concept. You can take the moral high ground in your actions and go Paragon, or be a little more brutal and shift towards Renegade. Whichever way you go obviously alters the way people interact with you and even has an effect on your appearance. You don't have to go 100% either way, but you will definitely have moments where you'll need to be specced deep into one tree to make a really important choice, so it's best to go the full ham and commit to one side or the other.Because of its choose-your-own-adventure style, there's a lot of replayability if you want to explore different threads of your choices. I know that I still need to replay this and save a character who I didn't manage to save on my first playthrough. I'm stubborn and I want to keep them around for the next games. Oh yes, there's two sequels.. your choices and your crew will port over into them (by choice) so you may now go and lose a large chunk of your life to this amazing game. It's worth it.\n",
      "Ignore the bugs and you'll have a good time. Sometimes it can be a bit frustrating, but overall I found this game quite enjoyable. Controlling your hits and swings to conserve stamina and your weapons longevity is really interesting.It takes some getting used to that there's no AI director spawning random zombies (I've been spoilt by L4D) so you will get the same undead experience in co-op or solo - co-op simply makes it more fun and of course killing zombies gets a little easier. I recommend co-op for the experience, but at the same time it can be annoying if you want to level a certain character but can't get all of your co-op friends online. However there is an open mode where you can play with strangers if you're game enough to gamble.Yes the jump animations are silly beyond belief, but this is part of the charm when playing co-op. Ultimately you're in it to have fun, so when physics has a moment and sends zombies flying into walls, or fallen limbs duplicate, it may remove you from the game but it's still hilarious when it happens. It's the kind of game you can reminisce about later, guaranteed to give you funny stories.It's definitely got a lot of hours of playability with the story, side quests and various collectables. The islands areas are huge and there's certain places you can go, like the Quarantine Zone in the city, that offer tougher challenges and larger waves of infected. Once you reach the jungle, you can even find a cabin with Jason, a machete-wielding maniac wo can be a tough fight depending on your level and what weapon mods you've got equipped (but come on, we all know the shock mods are the best).I'd say if you're in two minds about this game, watch some playthroughs on YouTube or borrow a friend's copy to try before you buy. Me, I think it's fun.\n",
      "Very fun game for the laughs and giggles especially when you die to the most stupid things. Thes best part is unlocking the multitude of characters available for you to fight with. The bad things is the game can be glitchy when playing online with your friend. Get the bugs sorted and it's a great game.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong. Robocraft is a perfectly good game and all, but I do not recommend playing it. I will address why towards the end of the review. For now, let me address the critical aspects of Robocraft as a whole.GameplayThe Gameplay ranges from average to great - solely depending on how serious your teamates are about winning. The game consists of you and your team building whatever vehicles you want and setting about demolishing the other team. As of the date this review was made, you can have access to 5 different ways to blow the enemy sky high: SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, Tesla blades and a Nano-beamer which can restore allies vehicles. You can stack Tesla blades with other guns, but you can't have an SMG with a Railgun. The problem is that these are not very well balanced: Railguns are far worse than Plasma cannons, just as an example. Remember how I said that the battles can range up to great depending on your teammates? If you are using a railgun, you are literally dependant on your allies protecting you while it is recharging. And it takes a long time to do so, during which you are more vulnerable than a snowflake in a volcano, for lack of a better analogy. And since blowing up enemy vehicles is a part of the game, you can blow up individual parts of the enemy vehicles - in the time in takes for you to read this review up to here, you can now fire your railgun again, except you can't because someone has blown it up. Now you have to wait for someone else to come across and restore your guns so you can defend yourself. And now you are dead because your healing ally is busy polishing someone else's vehicle. And this happens more often than not. I should mention that the tier system in place for research (yes, research requires you to acquire Tech Points in varying tiers, and unless you pay real money, there is no way to cross-tier your Tech Points) is not that great - more than once have I seen Nano-beamers (which are acquired at Tier 7, minimum) used in a Tier 2 or 3 match, I have once had the pleasure of seeing an enemy using a Tier 10 Plasma in Tier 4 - Ouch is a massive understatement. At least now you have boss fights where a lot of T4s can fight a big, bulky, one-shotting T10. But this happens so rarely it might as well not have been implemented.There are items you can acquire to help you stealth your way around the map, such as Radar Jammers, but then the enemy can just spot you by pressing Q - which makes you very obvious to every enemy on the map - so there isn't a point. Also, only two parts of your vehicle - the pilot seat and the block it is sitting on - determine life or death.In order to acquire better stuff, you either pay endlessly (It takes at least $20 and a lot of grind to unlock everything in one sitting), you have to not only acquire Tech Points, but also Robo Points which are used for purchasing stuff once you have it available. Up until recently, dying yielded you a lot less points, even if you wiped out more than half the enemy team - the emphasis is on surviving rather than killing. Ironically, killing is the only way to acquire more points to pore into your vehicles. And that is pretty much all I need to say about the Gameplay.AestheticsThe Aesthetics are not exactly what I would call good, but it isn't terrible either. Robocraft is one of those games where you can literally build anything you want and it would be the way your vehicle is. Wait a minute, \"build anything you want\"? Isn't this somewhat vaguely familiar? As in overdone by this point? Not that this game does it poorly, but I think I have seen enough ugly vehicles, that are ugly on purpose, but I have seen some rather... rude... looking vehicles. There is very little moderation in terms of vehicle aesthetics. Otherwise, some of the maps are very good and are pleasing to look at, but then you build a flying vehicle and seen the endless plains outside the map. If it were me, I would have just used a skybox - they already implemented a force field to prevent you from leaving in a flying vehicle. At least a high-res Skybox would have been acceptable, and would yield less complaints, and would have been a lot more processor friendly. And that is all I have to say about Aesthetics - they are only graphics and are only responsible for maybe 20% of a game's value.SoundtrackThe soundtrack, even when the music volume is on full, can be rather quiet at times. I get it, it is supposed to create tension when I do rarely hear it, but if anything it annoyed me. Maybe that is because I prefer the soundtrack in any game to fit what the game is about - I do not associate the need for stealth with a game that is clearly about blowing the pilot seat out of a heavily armoured vehicle, and where stealth does little more than get you killed quicker if you try. I ended up turning off the music and listened to the Tyrian OST - which was much more suitable, but  I just happen to be listening to another game's OST while playing this one. So yeah, go figure.DeveloperI understand most people would not recommend a game because of its developers. This happened to Paranautical Activity, the developers said some rather nasty stuff to their fans and to Valve, and as a result they had their game kicked out. But the Developers for Robocraft are not like that at all. They regularly add new patches to their game to make it more fun - recently, a \"Hero Bonus\" was added to compensate those people that die wiping out more than half the enemy team. And they make newspaper articles to hint at new features being developed. They also take some feedback on the odd occassion, albeit more of an acknowledgement than anything. For a team of 10 people, what they have achieved is pretty good so far. I encourage them to make a game that you have to pay money to play, as opposed to \"Pay to win\", which is what Robocraft is rather sadly.Anti-Hacker PolicyOk people. I said that I don't reccommend this game and here is the reason. Now, I'm not a hacker, and as someone who will eventually get into game development, I fully understand the concerns that developers have for their games to ensure that people don't cheat to win. But there are far better ways of doing this than using EasyAntiCheat (also called EAC, Robocraft refers to its system as Roboshield). In case you don't know why anti-virus software has such a big problem with EAC, it is because EAC literally acts like spyware. When you play Robocraft, you are giving permission for the guys at EAC to monitor your personnal details. They can rename it however they like, it doesn't change what they are doing. Having access to your data is basically giving up your privacy for security, an area that is already being heavily debated in the Information Technology industry (remember the PAPA framework anyone? If you don't, I suggest you Google \"Mason, PAPA Framework\"). In anycase, they tell us that EAC is using the data being data-mined to detect hackers and such, but that is a lot of processing power being used, and I have trouble believing that it is all for 'verification' of the game's validicity. True, this is EASY Anti Cheat that FreeJam are using, but nothing is ever labelled as EASY unless there are ways around it. You may have noticed that less than 50% of Robocraft players are hanging around, and even that number is ever decreasing due to EAC. A far better and more person friendly approach would have been to use Valve's Anti Cheat (also called VAC). For one, VAC doesn't act like spyware, it is server side only (which is another advantage, you can't have your users decompile your EAC on their client to find exploits and whatnot) and uses less processing power which can free up more servers. And while yes, VAC is open-source, this is actually an advantage.And that is the review. DO NOT PLAY until they use VAC instead of EAC. Hopefully, they will correct that mistake soon.\n",
      "Everyone is so friendly in this game, 10/10 would let my kids play.\n",
      "Well first. This isnt a reccomendation its THE OPPOSITE. Areas are blocked off from the world by invisible walls which in a i guess game genre like this is a bad thing since exploration should reward with loot like a diablo type game but this one completely says ♥♥♥♥ you if u try to think oh hey im gonna explore here. The animations are horrible and the level up system is boring with the oh hey put a few attribute points into this skill and even if i did eventually get spells from skills with the horrible combat it woudlnt matter (acording to a friend this game was also designed for an Ipad im not sure if this is true but what do u expect and at this point i really dont want anything to do with...THIS)\n",
      "Decided to write this one a quick review because at the time of writing it's on sale. I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great. If you happen to read this after a sale, it is still worth getting it over the other two if you want both.\n",

      "The admins of this server made me feel very sad and depressed. They excluded me and my friends on this starwars event. I would like to say... #### the admins of that server and please make better admins of this server .... PLEASE\n",
      "My friends ridicule the ♥♥♥♥ outta me when we play anything. But I cop more abuse and death threats in this game. 10/10 gameplay 0/10 self esteem.\n",
      "This game is just perfect, it takes a lot of effort to start out :) but with friends its angelic :D\n",
      "This game is fun as all hell. Animations are fancy and the soundtrack is brilliant. Only kind of music to bump off zeds to. Blood all over the place, body parts flying. Doesn't that sound fun? Do I need to say more? A game called killing floor needs no narrative, it doesn't need much of a story line. It already has what it needs. Where did these zeds come from and why am I hunting them?Well it does need a bit more content, but it is early access so I expected about as much content as it has. So if you're not patient, then I don't recommend you buy it. But at the price it is now, I do recommend you buy it. $30 for an eventual $60 - $80 game. Definitely worth it. I love it so much that I'll also be buying it on PS4 when it comes out. For two reasons; great game and I have a lot of friends who only play console and don't have PC'sI can't really explain the gameplay to someone. All I can say is the gunplay is amazing and like I mentioned before the animations are terrific. Reload animations, pointless ammo checking animations, sword swinging animations, cleaning the blood off of a weapon, it's all beautiful ♥♥♥♥. Personally for me sometimes in a game it's attention to small details that make a game good. But that's my opinion.Overall this game is good for someone who likes to blow stuff up, shoot stuff down, cut stuff around and just generally tear ♥♥♥♥ up. Not so much for someone who is looking for a movie-like story.\n",
      "Have the urge to kick some zombie butt? Don't wanna be a loner in a zombie-filled world? Well then, Left 4 Dead 2 is the game for you. The concept of the game is pretty basic - join forces with three other players and beat up some zombies with a frying pan, or if you're tired of hearing the screams of dying infected - be the infected AND HEAR THE SCREAMS OF THE SURVIVORS INSTEAD. HA HA!Basically, if you get bored of playing as the survivors, the game gives you the option to fight against other players as 8 different special infected ranging from long-tongued Smokers and crying Witches to acidic Spitters and \"my vomit brings all the zombies to the yard\" Boomers, while some have their advantages and disadvantages, they are still very fun to play (sometimes). All I have to say is that L4D2 is one of my favourite games to play - especially with friends - and I want to emphasise the ESPECIALLY. Don't get me wrong, playing with random players is still pretty fun, but can be off-putting if they're too good and immediately overpower other players, including me (which happens quite a lot, but hey, what can I say? I'm no pro at L4D2).Overall, I really enjoy this game and give this zombie-shooter a 5/5!\n",

      "First of all this is a very good game but it's definitely in beta. The AI sometimes doesn't like exploring the map and capturing points or attacking you unitll you attack them at their base. The path finding has units getting stuck, there is cover where there shouldn't be (curbs on the side of roads) and none where there should be (only 3 cover points around a van and none on power box's or waste high fences most of the time). Maps also need more versions or need to be more dynamic for larger FFA matches (3+ players).This game has a lot of potential and I highly recommend giving it a go if you have the friends for a match, (Some bugs I've encountered playing and improvements I'd like to see include)Bugs or general things which need fixing-Invalid target message when selecting units to attack a building-AI only capturing a few points in the start of the match and then just camping their own base-Path finding-Seriously need to check cover points on maps Personal points-Changing the Rebel’s captured point notification sound (possible getting some voice acting talent)-Allowed the player to assign units to a group using numbers 1-0 on the key board-C4 is TNT, change name or change image and model-Adding vehicles like the combine armoured car with a rocket ability and a Rebel jeep with an auto turret on top-Making transport vehicles-turret wall buildings for combine do not shoot enemy buildings-Make units be able to shoot while moving but be less accurate-Different click animation when selecting you units to attack the enemies.\n",
      "Ok, so I heard that the Witcher 2 was good.. but not this good!!! It converted me back into RPG's and Strong story telling in games! It is now my favourite game of recent memory and I cannot wait for the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

      "I dont usually write many reviews but In my opinion, this game is definiitely worth taking the time to write one up.My apologies if its a little cluttered, confusing or has spelling mistakes as Im in a bit of a rush.                                                          Pros / Things I enjoy about this game : - Many options to choose when creating a new custom race when beginning a new game.Which makes us gamer/customers feel more respected that we get to choose things like our own starting species, species names, council names, ships, starting weapons for starting planet, flags and designs, and the way we run ourselves as a goverment which will affect our relationships with other species we come across.For example, if we allow purging a colony on a world I just took over due to them being too difficult >:) and allowing slavery or slavery of robots. Or choosing to go against those ways completely and give other species their freedom and also robots the option of freedom and their own free will.The possibilities are endless.- After colonizing you can choose on the factions tab on the far top left in which you can choose to give the people/ species of that planet their freedom to govern themselves as a new empire/team. Which after doing so you are immediatley their protectorate.In which after you can give them their freedom.So in short, you can create other teams throughout the game... How good is that! :D- Game chooses the way the graphics are im fairly sure depending on your machine and what it can handle.The graphics are amazingly beautiful on my machine :O- The Price of this game is extremely cheap compared to what you can do in it and how long it will amuse strategy fans...Im completely hooked and im so happy about the price i paid for this game. What a bargain!- Battling is great fun to watch, and how it will turn out but there is also a con to this pro also :P- There are many Diplomacy choices to pick from including : Insulting someone, choose them to be your Rival, call of war, asking for peace, create an alliance, Become a protectorate or ask another team to be yours, Sending resources, technology, space explored and many others.- Custom Ship\\defence structure design is Amazing. Many options to pick from like :Choosing the name of the shipMany Weapons to choose fromAddons like armour, Power cores, ShieldsSections of the ship in the way it will look and what and how many weapon and addon slots they come with.                                                       Mix between Cons / My Constructive Critisicm : - It would be good to have some more character customization options at the start. Likes clothes and also additional options, for example slight face changes and clothes (Armor which represents a war like species, or gowns which represent a more peaceful species - which there are some already in it but would be good to have some more cooler looking ones)Also maybe being able to change the way our characters look throughout a game, like hair and clothes..My character could want a haircut or decide to change his clothe once in a while as he feels hes starting to smell a bit like Poopoo :P- Ships are very close together when battling, it would be good if the spacing was a bit more battle friendly on the eyes.And maybe letting us move our ships when in a battle instead of the computer taking over completely for us to just watch and hope the computer goes about the battle in the most strategic way possible.For example, if my ship has long range weapons i may wish to keep a distance from the enemy.While as when the ai takes over it may not move away from the enemy and stay within the enemies medium range weapons which is definitely not the strategy I would have taken as I came out of the battle with my ship destroyed and the battle lost :(A tiny bit hard to pick up at first with so many options and things to choose from and how the user wants to go about conducting themselves as a nation. But once you've picked it up its completely awesome. Just hang in there and keep at it as its definitely worth it! Trust me- This is a fairly small con but still im a little picky. The different Zooming stages can be a little annoying to change between to get the view i was happy with.Maybe creating a few more zooming stages which are closer together with using the mouse wheel would be good.                                                                               Summary :Thats about all i can think of for now. There are many many more things that I love about this game, but i have things to do now, for example, start up Stellaris :DSo yeah I definitely Recommend this game.If youre thinking whether or not to buy this game, Buy it! Im sure any space or strategy game fan will love it.Have fun and Peace out Steam Community :)I give Stellaris : 9/10\n",
      "I bought this to play with friends a long time back then stashed it away. Was going through my games library and rembered starting the campaign but wondered why I didn't carry on, it was a good game with good graphics and a interesting story. Read comments section on Uplay and remembered the horror that is Uplay. Now I can't forget about it soon enough...\n",

      "Perhaps one of the best games I have ever played, now with an amazing multiplayer mod, if you enjoy the freedom of the single player then I highly recommend playing this mod. Mid air collisions, highspeed races, this game already had it all and now you can enjoy it with friends.\n",

But I would like the option to character change upon death and going to jury rigged portal in endless, because I DON'T believe that you can and STARVING as the same characters TOGETHER would get boring:P can't stop the puns\n",
      "so op whem you play with friend\n",
      "Honestly, the game is a challenge to get used to - I'm not disputing that at all. It's good to have a challenge. However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.Codies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your ♥♥♥♥ together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.There's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **\n",
      "Since purchasing this game, space engineers has quickly become one of my favorite titles in my library even thought it's still in early access. Space Engineers is a game based around creating ships for mining, combat and salvage using a relatively simple set of parts, such as rotors, cockpits and drills. These can be used to create simple combat ships piloted by the player, large cargo and player transport vessels or even remote mining drones, using the remote control and camera blocks currently implemented in the game. Space Engineers is easy to learn, but difficult to master. New players can quickly build a small ship for simple purposes and eventually move on to designing large-scale automatic mining drones and other such creations. The graphics are not particularly impressive, but certainly get the job done in a satisfactory way. The music and sound design fits the game perfectly, featuring songs of a graceful and occasionally epic timbre, perfectly fitting the graceful, epic setting of space. The inclusion of multi-player in this game is a welcome addition and is a lot of fun with friends who know what they're doing. The game is not perfect though, as can be expected with early access titles. Overall, Space Engineers is an incredibly rewarding and satisfying experience, both with and without friends to play with. If you are interested in physics-based ship construction or more complicated survival-based games, i would highly recommend that you support Keen Software House and pick the game up. Space Engineers in my eyes is amazing, thats why im giving it an 8/10 for its clever design and brilliant gameplay.\n",
      "Three ways to enjoy this game1. Solo it in normal to very hard 2. Play with a group of friends in Very hard to Death wish3. Always go loud (Play Vlad or Bain)BONUS! :D  If you like to stealth play the Elephant or Shadow raid (You must complete the following 3 steps to get the skills and perks you want)TIPs: Just keep shooting them! (AND NOT THE CIVILIANS!!!!) >:/\n",
      "really really fun game that requires you to think quite abit on strategy and what items to buy a game that death has a huge consenquence and suicide is respectable but once you win the match it will feel good. play with friends since if you play with strangers when you are still new they will say bad things about you when you screw up. when that happens click on the mute button\n",
      "At first I found this game a bit challenging, but after a bit of getting used to I have found it easier and is one of my favourite games of all time, recently I have been playing heaps and the community is a lot friendlier behind this game aswell, example at the end of a CS:GO game 'gg' at the end of a CoD game 'You fkn suck go to hell'. The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath.\n",
      "An Outdated engine and focus on features that don't improve on the core aspects that made DayZ mod the amazing game that it was. Instead of fighting in heart pounding tense situations and setting up camps with friends, you'll be experiencing rage inducing bugs that make you turn away from this game from weeks to even months on end. I hope soon that I can write a positive review and say great things about DayZ SA but right now I would recommend that you save your money until the game is worth it.\n",
      "Amazing game to play with friends and even vs AI. - must play if you like stratagie games/RTS and Space\n",

      "Insurgency is a game about how your team understands the situation, and reacts to it. It's class based gameplay, has little restriction, and can be punishing. Ammo is not a problem, you'll only go through at most 3 mags in a round, and enemies drop primary weapons (you only get what was left in the clip). The game's graphics are suiting, but you can get some stunning moments, and some funny ones. watch the friendly fire, and explosion radiuses, as this is a hyper-realistic anti-terrorist simulator.\n",
      "First of all, why hasn't this been done before, such a simple game, free, and personally, I would pay $25 for it, if not more.Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, is a turn-based strategy game, with anime-style graphics set in a distant future, humanity reigns supreme over the entire galaxy (and possibly beyond) two major factions are at each others' throats, but not at war (yet), The Solar Alliance, led by Admiral Grey, the Alliance controls most of the inner colonies, but like any other civilisation, there is much discontent in the civillian masses of the Neutral Rim, where pirates, bandits and marauderers fight with each other, and raid ships, y'know piratey stuff. On a world, beyond the Alliance's reach, a slave boy has grown up, and grown tired of the pirates, slavers and other criminal riff-raff, and forms PACT, an anti-alliance orginisation, hell-bent on taking control of the galaxy so they can help the common man. PACT sounds like a good faction when you look at the job description, but by action, it is clear they are no friend of anyone, not realising, or ignoring their inner-dictator, PACT attacks the neutral world Cera, home to captain Kayto Sheilds, and first officer Ava, who have been entrusted with the hyper-advanced warship, Sunrider.Together with a baker, a wannabe hero, a merc, a girl from another time, a discredited medical officer and a black ops agent (which you don't exactly start with any of them with you. The game has \"boss fights\" where only two of them have unique units, but every mission is strategic challange in itself. Even if you are a seasoned strategy veteran, you will have trouble later even on normal difficulty, and if you feel suicidal, try space whale difficulty.I'll forgive the lacking voice acting, and low gameplay-to-storyline ratio, because it was done so well.I couldn't help but be reminded of HOTD's soundtrack, and Halo's story whilst playing Mask of Arcadius, as it has it's own character, humour and soul, unlike most of the games we play.If you want a game that will make you laugh, cry, ragequit and do a victory dance (I certainly did all of these), Sunrier: Mask of Arcadius, is your game.Now for Love in Space's to do list:-Make an awesome game - Check-Make a sequel - in progress-Make an anime-DLC-(optional) Put a price tag on Mask of Arcadius-Nerf that awakened blackjack. (You'll see in the final mission.)\n",
      "I'll start off by saying that the pc port is absolute ♥♥♥♥. Even on the best hardware around this game will not stay at a stable 60 fps on high settings. But I still prefer the pc version over the console version. On the xbox 360 and ps3 the game often goes below 30 fps and crashes from time to time. At least the pc version never crashed when I played it and it never went below 30 fps on my pc. Also the online doesn't work anymore because gamespy closed down, so if you want to play with a friend you need to use hamachi or evolve and run a lan game.\n",
      "Great game heaps of fun, but a serious bit of advice. If you wat to win games then play with friends. Trust me, most randoms will make you want to jump off the side of the ship. Which is pointless, cause it just teleports you back up. Moral of story: Buy the game, buy a 4 pack.\n",
      "This is a fantastic game for people who either can't afford L4D or have friends that can't. It's gameplay is solid and each class feels useful in every map. This makes players spread between each class rather than selecting one OP class. Its great for casual play on easier difficulties and for more competent players on the harder difficulties. The maps at the moment are very limited, around 6 or 7, but its early access and the objective maps have two variations per map.Overall a very good game and it is well worth investing some time into playing it.\n",
      "The game is fun and I have enjoyed multiple hours with friends on Online. But the amount of hackers in the game is so appauling that you have to switch sessions every hour or so to avoid them.\n",
      "Firefall: A post apocalyptic battleground where humanity fights to survive against the chosen armada.I personally find this game a fun mix of MMO and FPS, the MMO part of skills, crafting and collecting badass weapons and the FPS of being able to rely on your own combat skills rather than rolling the dice. This game, when I first played it in early beta, had little to nothing to do. I literally just farmed exp until I got to the highest level, then stopped playing for 3 months. Now however it has way more stuff to do, like a wider variety of missions, open world events and (finally) a campaign.Pros: A good enough variety of missions to keep you entertained for quite some time.A cool way to get resources, where you have to defend a thumper while enemies attempt to destroy it.The Chosen can attack ad take over outposts, and sometimes have an invasion in a major city, which causes it to be engulfed by the Melding. (Storyline stuff, watch the game intro)Lots of different battleframes for players to choose from to satify their fighting style.Rewards players for helping each other, even when not grouped together.Rewards for doing specific challenges, like open world exploration.Cons: Map isn't small, but it wouldn't hurt to make it bigger.LGVs or the mounts used ingame are unavailable for crafting unless you hit lvl 40 (max level) or you buy one from the store.Short campaign (Is being worked on though ;D)When you finish the campaign it doesn't take too long before you find a repetitive cycle between missions.Character depth goes about as deep as lines like, \"I feel like we can do more, WE HAVE TO DO MORE!\" (Feel the emotion)Overall I would recommend this game because even though the missions are a bit lacking there is still plenty of things to do and places to explore, also by getting friends on, you form a squad and try the new Hardcore mode out for campaign.\n",

A great game. 8.5/10!\n",
      "Its promising.While yes, the AI is buggy almost to the point of hilarity and yes, your success or failure seems to hinge on wether or not you get a certain bug (my favourite was the security member who floated outside an airlock and waited until they suffocated), the game certainly has promise.I can't wait to play it as its closer to being complete. I look forward to taking the chance that a derilict station that has just shown up will in fact contain raiders, and having my builders knock out a wall section to make them all suffocate first. Of course I also did that to a station containing friendlies and felt a little guilty :)\n",

      "Beyond Sol was a game i only discovered a couple of day ago. I soon as i saw it i was hooked, the game looked really fun and amazing. Also it had multiplayer so i could play it with my brothers and friends. Here are the pros and cons!Pros:- Good Graphics (In my Opinion)- Fun- You get a fleet! It looks awesome to go into NLS - Good Combat- Random Events- City Building- Ship upgrades- Cool Explosions- It plays somewhat like a mix between the Spore Civilisation stage and the Space stage- Cool hexagonal territory capture system- Diplomatic, Economic and Militaristic playstyles- Mining- Money!- Doing Distress signals can increase you income! YES!- MultiplayerNow here are the cons. There is one REALLY bad one which seems to only happen to me? It has destroyed me a number of times. What happens is randomly the game will minimase itself and sometimes it wont let me back onto the game so i have to close the game and replay it again. Because of the handy save feature i dont lose any progress. I have died a number of times because it minimises during a heated battle and i cant fight back. It's very annoying.Cons:- Kinda reptitive- Negative dollars =(- Fighting early on can be fatal- Death during NLS charge, lol- random Minimising- Border tension screws you over- Always a pirate base nearbySo to sum it up, this game is absolutuely amazing and should be bought by lovers of space, strategy games. It is a fun game and gives you total freedom to take over the galaxy! Also Multiplayer. I have only played about 4 hours but trust me, that number's gonna get a WHOLE LOT BIGGER!9/10______EDIT_______Now this is something about the game (and my limited techical knowledge and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ router) that really ♥♥♥♥ing annoys me. Port ♥♥♥♥ING forwarding! A don't bloody understand how to do that ♥♥♥♥ and i don't think i ever will. It's so god damn confusing. I was really hyped to play with my 2 brothers but NO! The ♥♥♥♥ing port forwarding ♥♥♥♥ed everything up! It's soo sad since i really anticipated playing this with my peeps. Sorry if i am a bit angry nut i have been trying to do this ♥♥♥♥ for 3 hours and i realised i have got school in the morning so FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!Sorry about that outburst of rage against this games multiplayer. It's still a really good game but until it gets some sort of proper multiplayer system and not the cheap ♥♥♥ port ♥♥♥♥ing then maybe i will raise the score.6/10\n",

      "Brawlhalla reminds me of Super Smash Bros. Back in the day I used to love versing my friend on Super Smash Bros Melee on their GameCube, and because of those memories, I really love this game. First of all, let's go over the positives. That may seem backwards, but it'll lead up to my major gripe with this game.Positives:Really responsive gameplay on keyboard: I myself play with the Mouse and Keyboard set up. I feel like I'm always hitting what I should and missing what I should, the developers have done an awesome job with this, even though I live in Australia and we need to play on SE Asian matchmaking.Cool characters: I myself love playing a plethora of different characters such as Bodvar, Teros, Asuri, Orion and Lucien, and the lore that the devs put into the little world they've created really sucks me in. I love reading their lore when I'm waiting for friends to launch the game (which launches surprisingly fast), or if I'm just not playing at that moment.Awesome Lore: I know I touched on the lore when it came to the above positive, but I believed I had more to say about it. I simply love the lore, and the little tidbits they have around the character's main lore show how they relate to other characters and also what they did before arriving in Valhalla.And now, the:Negatives:Really, the only negative I can find is the spammability of the characters. Keep in mind, at the time of this review I have only 10 hours, so don't take my opinion like it's law, but that's my major gripe. Whenever I go up against a Hattori in my current 1v1 or even 2v2 ELOs (Both Bronze as of 16/11/2015), she seems to spam her Directional Heavy (Left/Right Rightclick/Rightbumper/K/X) every time I come close, so whenever I'm playing a character like, say, Teros, who's Heavy attacks need to be timed down to the split second, I feel at a disadvantage, and it always seems that way aswell, as whenever I believe I'm close to getting my Player Elo back to Silver, I get dropped down by a button mashing Hattori.That's the positives and negatives I've found with this game in my 10 hours of gameplay, they've done a very good job for a F2P game.And the moment you've all been waiting for, the  TL:DR VERSION! All in all, the game is pretty polished in a lot of the major areas, but there is also that, in my opinion, too-small gap of player skill. There's skilled players in the low to high elos and Not-So-Skilled spammers in the even higher elos. That being my major and only problem. Either way, I can totally recommend this to fans of Super Smash Bros and other Fighting Action Platformers.\n",

      "So, when this was given to me as a gag gift, and I played it, I found it to be... Not what I expected at all. It was a tiny square map with no scenery but a lamp, infinite waves of zombies that get stronger and grow in numbers as the levels go on, about 10 generic weapons and some completely over the top ones, and a soundtrack that you have to experience to understand why I can't talk about it.But to the point, if you get some friends online with you, this game is insanely unbelievably fun. Mainly because if you play alone you notice how frustrating the lack of anything on the map is, and how the fences get useless in the late game, and how that last death was total bullsh*t, and I guess that isn't a point in the game's favour but the absolute joy that comes with playing this co op excuses it.In summary, if you can convince your friends to buy it, you'll love it forever\n",

      "I did not know what to expect when I started this game. But I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. Within Dustforce DX is some of the most precise, well-constructed 2D platforming that you can experience. Its unique concept and fair set-up allows you to enjoy the game, no matter what your skill level. This is especially true provided the time and score system. If I were to provide a negative quirk, it would be the key system and hub which is not entirely user-friendly, and does become a bit of a hassle when transversing from stage-to-stage. Otherwise, it is a fun experience and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenging 2D platformer.\n",

Hackers fill all the lobbies and constantly kill innocent players and have every item without any effort at all. Rockstar is ♥♥♥♥ing hopeless. Money bags get dropped on people (happened to me three times, each time Rockstar banning me for some reason???!!??? ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!) Everytime I have sent in a support ticket, getting replied by a bot one second after posting. Nothing happened. I'm banned until 2035 for people dropping money on me!

      "This game is a waste of your money. This is what you would get if someone made a poorly made version of a total war game. There are also no multiplayer features other than a playing with a friend over a LAN network. I thought it was really disappointing. I give it 2.5/10.\n",
      "Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a game where you play as Adam \"Mass Murderer\" Jensen as he travels around the world accidentally killing entire populations of cities.

      "TL;DR: The game is boring, and multiplayer is buggy but it looks nice.This game has some serious issues, both technical and design oriented. After playing Trine 2 with friends and loving it, we decided to try out Trine 3. I got a bad feeling as soon as I learned there was no skill system, and from there the game got worse. In the first mission, we experienced a bug where only the host could see the animation of a puzzle, making me and my other friend useless in it. (Un)fortunately, it seems that all 3 characters now can do essentially the same things, making the puzzle possible even though only one person could interact with it. The addition of a third dimension (while adding depth to gameplay in some ways) mostly just made the controls a mess.The only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you liked the Trine series for the aesthetic, you will enjoy this game as it improves upon the graphics of the previous installments. However, if you liked Trine for the mayhem and fun that came from playing with your friends, it probably isn't worth a buy.I know that I only have around an hour of this game on record, and I think that that's an important thing to note when reading this review.Maybe I judged this game too quickly, but I'm not going to waste anymore time on a buggy, mechanicly void platformer.\n",

      "Well, this game has been something for me...I played this game pretty often and is considered one of the games I really enjoyed playing for a long amount of timeThe gameplay is simple, Play, grind, play with friends, grind, get better gear, go to auction and grind for more. It may sound really boring, but the gameplay experience with friends is enough to satisfy your whole day.Why give this a NO for a reccomendation? It's because the game's dead. Very few updates, very few online players also since the head developer left and SEGA not really supporting this game to its full potential, the game became too repetitive with no new contents now and then.It's still shiny, it looks good but the game experience is all gone. Definitely if you want to try it out go ahead, but it'll be a rough time for you to enjoy the game longer since not many people are active in the game\n",
      "As a fan of previous title 'PAYDAY: The Heist', PAYDAY 2 has shown a complete overhaul of game mechanics. With David Goldfarb from Battlefield 3 now part of Overkill, the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it is HARD. You will fail when you're a low level. Eventually, as you work your way up the crime ladder, you'll gain the necessary skills to spend, to complete heists a certain way. There's a new stealth system implemented, in which you can carry different weapons with different mods to lower your visibility and be detected slower. Guards can be killed and bagged to move around, but their pagers must be answered. Answering too many pagers will cause the operator to be unconvinced and set the alarm off. Of course, there's always the 'classic' PAYDAY approach.... Weapons have also been overhauled, and feel incredibly satisfying to use. They actually kick and feel like real guns, whilst the sound design suits it perfectly.This title has a large RPG element, in which you will now level up from getting xp on heists, and gain skill points to spend on skills in four different skill trees: Enforcer, Mastermind, Ghost and Technician. However, differing from the original PAYDAY, you cannot have all the skills in all the trees. As level 100 you can usually Max out 2 skill trees, and have a few in others or you can choose to spend them and become a 'Jack of all trades, but master of none'. Although this new system makes levelling up much more satisfying, it also rewards grinding heists, and as of such, many players simply speedrun heists for xp, (most notably Rats and Ukranian Job). Overall, it is an amazing game, and although it isn't quite for the casual gamer as the first PAYDAY catered to, it is immensely enjoyable with countless replayability due to randomisation of each heist. One of the best games ever made, especially when playing with friends, it is one of my favourite games of all time. It is being constantly updated with new material, and although all the things promised at launch are not present in the release, they are promised to come by Overkill, one of the few developers out there who don't simply milk money from their customers by releasing an unfinished game, no patches and an abundance of microtransactions. PAYDAY 2 has no microtransactions and all items are obtained in-game. (*Note: there are DLC packs with new heists and weapons, but obviously these are optional. You can also play these heists as long as the host has the DLC)I definitely recommend this game to fellow FPS and RPG gamers out there, and if you have your doubts, simply pick it up during its next sale!\n",
      "Fun to play with friends, very laugh inducing. Almost started crying at on point out of sheer laughter. Not as fun without friends. Just glad thus game doesn't take itself to seriously\n",

      "Graphics\t9A beautifully rendered world, extremely satisfying levels of destruction, grand animations, and an easy to understand interface. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has it all.Gameplay\t9At times, it feels like there are some frustrating balance issues. But those are few and far between. Bad Company 2 is a fantastic game to pick up and go to town with. You'll find glee in causing buildings to crumble around you, planting that charge of C4 on a tank and blowing it up, nailing that perfect headshot from across the map. However, where Bad Company 2 really shines is when you log on with some friends and get coordinated. Communicate and work together to outgun, outflank, and outdo the enemy team.Story\t4I'll be honest with you. If you are playing Battlefield games for the story, you're going to be really, really disappointed. While there is a storymode here, it honestly isn't worth much of your time except as a glorified tutorial. The characters do give a few good laughs though.Multiplayer\t10As mentioned earlier, Bad Company 2 really shines when you play with friends, but even alone you're going to have a blast with this one. Hours and hours of fun and destruction await you, with several different modes of multiplayer available to choose from. Be warned though, if you join up this late in the game you're going to face some very, very good long-time players.Replayability\t9You're going to keep coming back to this one. The peak of the Battlefield series so far, it never gets old racing out of a building as it crumbles around you, covering your team on a withdrawal from an overrun area, or being at the front of a charge to capture a point. Don't miss out on one of the most enjoyable Battlefield experiences yet. The only struggle here is that most your friends will probably have moved on to the new battlefields.Overall9.2/10Though not as popular as it once was (due to the new battlefields) Bad Company 2 still stands at the top of the Battlefield mountain. The Frostbite engine really shines in this iteration. Multiplayer is fast-paced, brutal, and spectacularly fun. Don't like those trees? Mow them down with your LMG. Don't like that building? Blow it up. Your team being overrun? Call in an artillery strike and give them some relief. All in all, an absolute must have for any Battlefield fan.\n",
      "Dark Crusade was probably my favorite RTS throughout my college years. While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory. This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.If you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed. However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors. That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's not to like.I'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade. Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time. Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game. The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun. I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it. Let's keep this game alive. For the Emperor\n",
      "Saints Row: The Third. I thought it was a very good game. The thing that got me the most was the comical humor. The costumes and wardrobes, to the sexual references and balancing dead bodies with exaggerated weapon effects. I found this game to be a LOT beter compared to Saints Row and Saints Row II. If follows the time line, which is always a plus. The amount of things you can do, in my opinion, is much more and better than GTA. GTA is more on a serious note, which is good; Saints Row: The Third has some serious moments, but knows how to offer a laugh and good time with a balance.The Story Line is pretty simple and basic, but not as generic as you would expect. You have a mixture of things, from saving your Homies, to fighting Gangs, Police, Military, Politicians, Zombies and Aliens. The gangs, especially one in particular are trying to take turf. What kind of gang isn't? The Genki line I found the most fun. It's basically like a game show arena. You fight your wat through enemies as well as the environments. It's definitely rewarding in the end, but not as much as it should be. In the end, you begin to gather forces for a take over. A bloody, deadly and annoying battle takes place.The Combat System was very fun. Shooting duel pistols at enemies and watching them fly across the street. The Genki Mobile went shoots flames around all sides of the car as you drive, leaving a flaming inferno of destruction in your path. Falling from a disintergrating plane and shooting people as you fall with style. Fighting in wrestling rings with other gang members. Or you can do it with classic style by running them over with your cars and going on a shooting rampage. Some people may frown on it, but it is only a game after all. It could even relieve some frustrations.Didn't have much of an Online Experience. It's pretty difficult to find others willing to play or willing to stay. So, unless you have a friend to play this with, I would recommend that more. At least if you want the achievements that go with this.\n",
      "Thirty minutes into Saints Row IV and you’ve shot our way through a military base before disarming a nuclear bomb in flight, winning the hearts of the nation and the presidency of the USA. You’ve signed off on a cure for cancer or ended world hunger, and fended off aliens from a turret gun on the White House lawn. It’s immediately clear that Saints Row has finally abandoned any of the pretence at gritty underworld realism that was so at odds with the slapstick of previous games in the series. This is the game that finally provides an appropriate thematic context for Saints Row’s mechanics, one that sees the Steelport Saints emerge from Grand Theft Auto’s shadow once and for all.In Saint's Row IV, you once again take on the role of the leader of the Saints, a now globally recognised gang. After a series of events culminating in you riding a nuclear missile through the air to attempt to disarm it before it reaches Washington (don’t ask), it isn’t long before you become President of the United States yourself (of course). The good times don’t last long though, as humanity’s worst fears are realised when an evil alien race known as the Zin invades Earth. You and the other members of the Saints are held hostage in a simulated version of Steelport. With the help of your hacker friends Kinzie and Matt, and combat backup from the rest of the crew - including Vice President Keith David - you must disrupt the system enough to break free and hopefully save the human race. The Matrix came out fourteen years ago, and it’s getting to the stage that movies get to when you hear yourself saying “What do you mean you’ve never seen The Matrix?”, and then think to yourself “...oh I’m getting old”. However, as one of the most important films in its genre, you can forgive Saints Row IV for making quite so many references to it. Everything from “finding an exit”, down to diving into the very bodies of enemies and destroying them from within gets a mention. The pop culture references don’t stop there either, in fact I’m sure the rest of this review could be composed simply of the names of games, films and television shows Saints Row IV leans on. Some of them might seem a little outdated, maybe intentionally so, but if you just take everything the game throws at you as it comes, you’re certain to have a much better experience. Although it is a simulation, you will be familiar with Steelport if you played the previous game. The landscape is much the same, with most of the old locations in the same place. It is noticeably different though, with a liberal scattering of alien hardware, and a lack of sky and water. Since this world is simulated, the laws of the universe can be bent and broken. You now have what can only be described as super powers. Super sprint allows you to travel faster than any car ever could, and combined with Super Jump you can clear multiple city blocks in a matter of seconds. You have a limited stamina bar, but it isn’t long before you upgrade your powers and it becomes irrelevant. At this point you can leap around to your heart’s content. The movement in this game is stupidly fun to control, making the usually boring matter of getting to your next quest location a joyous exercise. Your powers also stretch to you being able to shoot out fire and ice from your hands, smashing down into the ground with great force, and even letting you move objects, and people, around with telekinesis.The combat still holds up well too. In addition to all the weaponry from the previous game, you have access to all kinds of alien tech. The Dubstep Gun, The Singularity Gun and the Inflato-Ray are some of the most amusing, and most satisfying things to use in any recent video game. As before, you will still be upgrading your character as you play through the game using Cache, which accumulates by performing pretty much any action in Steelport. Mayhem missions return, where you cause as much damage as possible in the time limit. Insurance Fraud has you playing in traffic to generate money. Instead of car racing, you will be racing using your super jump and sprint. You will be hacking shops in a minigame which is a slightly altered version of Pipeline. These side activities provide a distraction from the main quest line, but none of them are particularly worth spending too much time on. In fact it is the most basic of video game concepts that ends up being the best thing to do in your downtime. Collecting Clusters, found on rooftops and walls throughout Steelport, allows you to upgrade your special powers. Since the platforming is so good, it almost becomes a compulsion to head straight towards a Cluster when you see it. The main story missions are where Saints Row IV shines. The writing is top notch, although you will definitely want to have played at least Saints Row The Third to appreciate a lot of the referential jokes. The game is filled with laugh out loud moments, not only from the dialogue, but often even just from the very situations you find yourself in. Each of your crew members has their own Loyalty Mission, which grants them superpowers of their own upon completion. These are side missions worth doing, while other quests in the game aren’t really necessary unless you’re going for all of the achievements. The main missions alone will take you a decent amount of time, and to complete everything in the game will take up to around twenty hours, especially if you want to get Gold in all of the challenges. I have mixed feelings on the way the game looks. I wasn’t a big fan of the dark and gloomy visuals of the simulation, but the way every texture shimmers every now and then as the computer program occasionally slows up is pretty cool. The frame rate remained pretty constant, even when it seemed like the entire screen was exploding, or when I was running at hundreds of miles per hour through city streets leaving a trail of destruction in my wake. The only time it occasionally hitched was during an autosave, but it was barely noticeable. The customisations are as deep as ever, and still allow you to look pretty much however you want, as well as bringing in a “Nolan North” option for your character’s voice.Overall Saints Row IV is a marvellously enjoyable game, while still suffering from a few of the complaints that the series has always had. The main quests are great, and although the side missions are not painful to play, they don’t pack the same punch. If you played and enjoyed Saints Row The Third, then picking up this sequel is a must. Equally if you’re looking for a game that lets you act like a badass with special powers, this might be a better superhero game than many others that are actually billed as such\n",
      "My favourite thing about this game is it’s captivating story. With a lot of humour, this game pulls off an action shooter with RPG aspects and a storyline you should follow. There are lots of sidequests that will take hours to complete, but the benefits of completing this game are well worth the time. With millions of different guns, a lot of different character skins and a unique experience with all the various classes, this game has hours of fun built straight in.The game will be fun no matter which class you play, but that’s not entirely due to the class. I found that most of the classes really lack something to keep you interested in, and throughout the whole game it feels like more attention was given to certain classes over others. Story-wise, the siren is pretty much the only class that gets any attention and backstory, as an individual with a history and as a class with abilities. All of the classes have a slight amount of backstory that becomes obvious throughout the game, but Siren has significantly more, and even then it’s very little.Beyond that, the entertainment value of playing as certain classes over others was very noticeable to me. I played as all the classes, including the 2 DLC classes, and some of the abilities and skill trees and other class-specific aspects were lacking for a bunch of the classes. Some things that were common for all of the classes were that there are certain skill trees that seem obviously better than other ones and significantly simpler to think about, making them seem more attractive, and all of the classes lack enough in-game backstory to really get a feel for them. With all these classes, it comes down to a matter of opinion, what sort of playstyle you like and other such things, but I’ve found that there are some that are distinctly more enjoyable than others.I think if there were more random Echo Recorders placed around the maps with a bunch of stories about the characters, with more information on them the game could be a lot more interesting. Throughout my playing of the game, I found a couple about Maya (the siren), one about Zer0 (the assassin/ghost) and nothing about any other character. That’s always been something that annoyed me. The stories of the characters may exist somewhere, but if they do, they are probably too hard to find.In terms of story, I loved this game. There was a hint of humour in just about every interaction you had with the other characters, and the story overall was very captivating and kept me playing. I think the end-game was a bit lacking and didn’t completely match up with the story, but it was still interesting and I don’t regret playing this game through at all. The side quests in this game were very extensive, and easily one of my favourite aspects of the game. Some sidequests are very tedious and boring, but others are absolutely a blast, like those given to you by Tiny Tina (pun intended ;) ).The replayability of this game isn’t infinite, it does get boring to play through the same parts over and over again in this game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play it more than once at all. Replaying the game in True Vault Hunter Mode, a difficulty increase that allows you to replay the game using your already powerful character, can still be quite fun. The difficulty of the game overall becomes harder while maintaining the same story with no new additions aside from more powerful guns.The playstyle in this game is very different from that of most other shooters. In Borderlands, you don’t really need to conserve any ammo and you can run around, jump and do a bunch of other crazy things while still attacking enemies. This makes the game more casual and relaxed, which I found to be pretty enjoyable. You very rarely run out of ammo, with all the excessive boxes with tons of different types of ammunition and the cheap price at which you can buy ammo in shops. That brings me to my next point, which is the excess of money in this game. There is very rarely an opportunity where spending money makes much sense or is beneficial, with ammo being really cheap and not really affecting your money and most of the items in shops being pretty bad compared to the ones you can get outside from drops. I know a lot of people enjoy using the slot machines at Moxxi’s bar, but I never found it that entertaining when it for the most part doesn’t get me anything decent. Pretty much the only point of collecting money is to get the badass ranks.The whole badass system is something I really like in Borderlands. Being able to slightly upgrade your character in about every way imaginable pretty awesome. Slowly, you’ll amass badass ranks by completing these missions, the more difficult missions resulting in more badass ranks, and for every 25 badass ranks you’ll get 1 badass token which can be used to upgrade one of the 5 stats presented. I really like the additional content that this adds to the game.Personally, I far prefer playing this game with other people. I don’t like playing very many games alone, and even if I’m playing a singleplayer game, I like to be talking to other people at the same time. I find it a lot more enjoyable, and the same thing applies to this game. I’ve never played this game without other people simply because every moment allows for a lot more laughing and interaction when you’re doing it with other people. If I had played through this game alone, I might have noticed some interesting bits of humour, but I never would have started laughing hysterically at some glitchy motion or funny joke. The enjoyment is multiplied by a lot when playing this game with other people.Something I noticed is that everyone plays this game differently. Personally, I like to play it patiently, doing all the sidequests, and being sure I’m making the right decisions with my skill points and gun choices. When I play Borderlands, I also like to play for as long of a period as possible. Of course I know nothing is that big of a deal, but I like being patient with this game and spending time on everything because I like feeling that I’m making the right decisions. Some of the people I have played with like to speed through the game and skip any extra content and make the easiest decisions possible. I think it’s important to play with people that have at least a similar mindset to you so that you aren’t being forced to play in a way that you aren’t entirely comfortable with.Warning: Slight spoilers in following paragraph. Reader discretion is advised.The final boss of the game really irked me. There was a whole obsession with how it was summoned using a siren and the key, both of which are very eridium oriented. The final boss used a lot of fiery attacks and swam in the pools of lava that surrounded the boss fight. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they were pools of molten eridium or something, with the boss spewing out eridium, or at least something purple, rather than fire. This game also has some really amazing individual lines. They are scared all throughout the game, but easily my favourite is the line that Scooter says when you meet him in Sanctuary. I’ve probably ruined the rewatching of that line several times when replaying the game with friends, through my inability to repeat the line properly and because I keep on trying.Overall, this game can easily be worth $20 depending on how much you play it and how much you enjoy it. I’d recommend getting it on sale simply because I’ve seen it go on sale reasonably often, for at least 66% off, but the game is also getting older and the Pre-Sequel (another game in this series, taking place between the first and second games) did come out recently. Quite simply, I love the amount of humour in this game, it’s a fun game to sink plenty of time into, and probably one of my top 10 all time games because of how much of a blast I had with it.\n",
      "My hours. help.I wrote something for real!These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun <3\n",

      "PAYDAY 2 is a very fun experience to play with people online, friends or even by yourself. With personal preferences on ways to play the game through difficulty (Going from really easy to ball-busting hard), PAYDAY 2 provides a variety and puts a new playstyle on gaming that is rarely seen. With not just bank heists, but also drug busts, art pieces to steal and MANY more, the game is fun for almost anyone. One of my favourites. If I would rate out of 10, I'd say...8.5/10!\n",
      "Don't get me wrong. I am the biggest Dark Souls fan you will arguably meet. It is my favourite game series of all time and I was undescribably hyped for this game. As of now, I cannot recommend it. Although my PC isn't the best, I get a decent amount of frames which do make the game playable but that would make it a positive review, right? The game is bugged. It is in a bad, unstable state and needs to be patched. Currently, I cannot attack enemies and they cannot attack me. I can walk through them as if they were not there. I really hoped this wouldn't continue, but I cannot progress through the game. Many of my friends with good PC's also complained about the extremely long start-up times and FPS issues. However, from my point of view I cannot play the game. This review warns people of the bug and I hope this issue is fixed as I am desperate to play this game.EDIT: Discovered the only way I can be attacked or enemies can be attacked is if you strike their initial spawn location. Still makes the game unplayable.\n",

      "Following the critical acclaim of Hitman: Blood Money, Absolution didn’t really hit the mark for most people. Diverting away from the previous formula in the Hitman franchise, Absolution focused on more linear levels with a problematic disguise system to boot. Luckily however after much confusion around the release structure, the new Hitman is back to form with the largest levels in the franchise and countless amounts of ways to deal with your targets, and with a seemingly weekly content drop, this game will surely take you for a ride.The new Hitman is split into 4 different modes. Firstly is the main story missions which generally task you with completing a hit on one or more targets and or completing a secondary objective like the second mission Sapienza’s bio lab sequence where you have to instead destroy a piece of evidence as well as your normal assassination targets. The second mode is called an “Ascension” where you have to do a mission 5 times, each consecutive completion however introduces a new objective or modifier such as only using a certain disguise or hiding all bodies in 90 seconds. Thirdly are the “elusive targets” these are limited time missions where you only have one chance to take out a target and are ranked against your friends, these also have new lines of dialogue to keep things fresh. Lastly is a mode returning from Absolution where users can make their own missions, they set parameters such as disguise and weapon, they then have to complete the hit themself.You then attempt to beat the creators own score and time, which is then also added to the leaderboard of that contract. What all this means is that Hitman has plenty of content to keep you going as long as you don’t mind that it all occurs on the same maps, but learning as much as you can about each of these intricately designed maps is what Hitman is all about.The release schedule for Hitman is centered around the idea of monthly “Episodes”, there are to be 7 in total with six featuring full new locations, however the next one is a strange mid-season break where they are instead introducing new ideas into 2 of the pre-existing levels. For the space in between these episodes the developers scatter a couple new missions, either being elusive targets or the ascension mission to keep you going if the user generated content isn't enough. When the game was originally released you were given 2 training missions and one main mission Paris which involves a large multi-story fashion show, which can currently be bought alone as a starter pack if you’re unsure about committing to the full game, but now with the release of Sapienza, a full italian town. And finally Marrakesh which is a moroccan city where a political uprising is occurring outside a swiss embassy. This means that Hitman is feeling more and more like a complete product, and as a fan of the series I feel safe in knowing that my purchase has been smart so far, and knowing that more maps are coming in the future only gets me excited. Because in the new Hitman each map feels distinct, paris is a very tightly packed affair dense with opportunities, Sapienza is sprawling with many interesting locations and assassination opportunities, and Marrakesh which falls in between, as it is more horizontal like Sapienza but features a dense population in its crowded marketplace.Each map is impressive in its own way, the designers have obviously had a ball trying to stuff in as many interesting assassination opportunities as they could. On paris I dropped a lighting rig on the main target as he walked down the fashion strip, Sapienza featured me placing an explosive golf ball on my targets tee that he then proceeded to hit with a significant amount of force, leading to his unfortunate “accidental” demise. And Marrakesh where i killed my target by cutting the wire on a light which was touching a handlebar which my target then grabbed onto, electrifying himself. Each level is full of stuff like this, and it’s always fun completing them, because you have the option when you start the game to have “opportunities” turned on, I would recommend turning this to “minimal” where the game will notify you of what assassination opportunities there are, but won’t tell you how to complete them like it will in the “full” mode.The core progression of a Hitman mission begins with you deciding on where you are going to spawn in, and what gear you will bring with you. This involves a concealed weapon, generally a pistol, and two pieces of gear like a coin to distract people, or a lockpick to get you past the occasional locked door. You are also then able to select a secret drop location where you can receive a large weapon such as a sniper, however these can be seen on your character, meaning you can be recognised in most disguises. You then set off on your way, scoping out your target, where they go, what opportunities await you, generally you will want to look for a new disguise which will allow you access into higher security areas. The new disguise system works much better than that of Absolution as well, you will now only be able to be detected wearing a disguise by those either of very high rank such as the target, or some highlighted senior workers of your own disguise. For example you can dress as a chef but the head chef can detect you whilst the other workers cannot, different to how it worked in Absolution. These new mechanics are in reference to the older games, but modernising and improving on them, fixing the ones that didn't work in Absolution.Some things that don’t sit well with me however, one thing is that perhaps the arrangement of these levels should have been thought out a little more before launch, Hitman’s first real level is Paris, which is a very dense level both horizontally and vertically, requiring you to have quite a lot of knowledge about how the disguise system works and some of the quirks in the AI to successfully complete, which seems rough if you are new to the series, giving you Sapienza instead which is a lot more spread out but still challenging, in the sense that it is more focused on you getting creative in your decisions instead of which uniform you are wearing to not get patted down by guards.Ultimately however Hitman is a surprise, it's wishy washy marketing leading up to the game's release in terms of its final episodic form hurt it somewhat. But the game has proven to be worth the wait, every time a new piece of content is added to this game, I have no problems jumping back into it, just to see where it will take me next.The Digital Horizon\n",
      "I played this game after being recommended it by a friend. I found it absolutely amazing! The way the highways match up to the song is brilliant.\n",
      "Excellent game, good value and especially coop feature makes it highly entertaining playing with a friend to complete missions and is a great feature sadly missing from most games. Downloaded content is good value and extra campaigns are excellent with hopefully more to come. Definately worth it.\n",
      "have more hours on sniper then 50% of my friends list' hours on tf2.it died for me\n",
      "I have only played this game 4 or 5 times look at the hours i have done... Anyway this game is amazing you start from warriors and scouts to knights gunmen tanks and best of all MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING GAINT ROBOTS... But ofcource this game is online i played with my friend and we had a competition to see who will nuke each other first.. ( i won ) but it took us like 1 whole day just to do that ------------>GET THIS GAME<-----------\n",
      "this game is really fun, i cant stop playing it, but one of these friend i had were right, if this had a story mode to play it would probably help me understand why they are using dragons and lazers nnnd stuff, itd also explain what those giant ships are. Over all that tho this game is great and id 100% recommend this game.\n",
      "Pretty good game to party up with friends and have a great time, the graphics are pretty smooth and nice looking and the navigation and shooting is done pretty well definately worth the money. But then again i only bought it for $10 on sale a few months ago and bought Gage weapon pack #1 and #2 and the courier mod pack on steam summer sale. $30 is a pretty average price for the game.\n",
      "This game truly amazing it may be pre alpha but i haven't had many problems with it this is possibly one the best pre alpha games i have ever played.This game gives you a glimpse of what a apocalytic struggle would be like. You choose whether you want to fight along through the struggle with people that are friendly other survivors or you can fight with people that kidnap, steal and kill other survivors (bandits) you choose.\n",
      "This game is good fun. It is like most survival games where it is better to play with friends. I lke the rp aspect of game, sure the game still needs work but that is what alpha is. The devs are doing a great job so far.  10/10 IGN\n",
      "Where do I start,I'm a total wimp when it comes to horror games, but i've been leaning towards some good ones on the xbox. One day I was watching youtube when I get a text from a friend saying \"FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 4 IS SOOOO SCARY YOU MUST PLAY IT!\" And I thought to myself that there's no way that this is as scary as silent hill right. I am the biggest idiot on the internet. I honestly thought that Scott was going to screw it up with FNAF 4 after not doing such an amazing job on FNAF 3, but by far this is the scariest game i've played in a long time. The animatronics are beyond terrifying and I like how Scott has added all this extra detail on freedy and all them that makes them truely scary. I have barely played the game and only on night 2 because i'm that freaked out, I got jumpscared on night 1 by bonnie at 2 am, how embarassing.Also, the new gameplay mechanics are superb. In the first three games, you are a adult security guard who at least has the slightest bit of smarts and the most ineffecive security system in all of video game security systems. I never got why the doors in FNAF 1 required power to stay down, couldn't gravity do that job, then I guess it wouldn't be a challenge. But enough of my rambling, FNAF 4 completely strips you off all sense of self security and makes the player a small boy in his bedroom with nothing but a torch, and i've got to say that Scott really captured that feeling of all alone with monsters surrounding you and all you can do is suck your thumb and wait for Bonnie or Chica to kill you.However there was one downside, The game does it's job too well. I get so scared in the atomsphere and the feel of the dark bedroom that if I hear even the slightest noise I immediately shut the game down because i'm actually afraid. Maybe I should stop playing the game at night with the lights off and my headphones on.Still, absolutely fantastic game. You've created a masterpiece and a legacy Scott and for that you deserve all the praise the series gets. I would put this up top with some of my favourite games. This game is like a shining diamond in what I call `the bleak industry of expensive games that don't live up' I'm looking at you COD Ghosts. I also find it really odd that most indie game developers can make better games than what a million dollar games company can't do with their endless pockets of gold encrusted rubies.Absolute must play for any fan of horror games.OVER 9000/10\n",

      "Pros:- Very satisfying combat- Very fun with friends - 'The Following' DLC is awesome - Drive around in a buggy and feels much more open compared to the main campaign. - Great weapon customization- Parkour- Skill tree (agility, power etc..)- The more you progress the better the game gets- Grappling hook- Arab musicCons:- Voice acting- Start of the game can get boring, (however as you progress missions start to get better)- Minor bugs that can sometimes interrupt gameplay- Be the zombieIf you don't have friends, don't buy the gameIf  you have friends, you should buy and play this game asap.tyoverall: 9/10 with friends, 1/10 without friends <- you are going to have a bad time :(((((((((((((((\n",
      "This game is a real treat if you want to try something new from a normal FPS let me explain[This is a bad review but...]Team Fortress 2, the name is what it means, unlike most FPS's Team Fortress forces you to work as a team (most of time) there are 9 different classes all with different abilities that can change the ride of war, for an example the scout, from his name you can run fast picking off weak enemies, and there is the heavy, a big buff Russian who can mow down anyone with his mini-gun but in return he is extremely slow.The gameplay is quite causal if you are in to that type, but you can also play competitive which you and your friends can fight other teams in your skill level.Also TF2 can also provide other entertainment like … hats.Ah, hats the soul of the valve economy, in this game you can change your characters appearance to your own liking you can also change you weapons as well depending in you like to play, an example for the spy, if you use a spy-cicle the bonus of using it is that you backstabs will be silent and if you get hit by fire you will be fire proof for 2 seconds if you come in contact with fire, but the downside is  that your enemies will turn to giant ice sculptures and when you come to contact with fire you have to wait for it to ‘respawn’ for 15 seconds.Either from all that random explanation of the game you should really try it; it’s the heart of steam and I will guarantee you’ll enjoy it, even by a bitBut for the final score10 out 10 I no longer no what outdoor's mean\n",
      "As we all know call of duty isnt what it use to be. I personally like the devs at treyarch studioes more then the other because of zombies and better multiplayer. But all in all every call of duty game is the same.This games campaign is much like all the other ones. Get introduced to the bad guy at the start, kill him at the end. Exept in this game is campaign is more dynamic, you can find hidden weapons, or boxes with mortars, swords, galvack nuckles, and other things. Multiplayer is pretty good in this game, not too many hackers (PS3), a unessararilly large variety of gun cammos, and a new cammo, diamond, it looks pretty cool. The maps are good, the DLC are good, not too much to argue.Zombies, is different. There are buildables, bigger easter eggs, and better DLC maps. My favourite map was alcatraz, there is so much easter eggs and hidden stuff.This game was made to be played with friends, but with the call of duty games, as far as im concered every cod since 04 could have been DLC. This game is one of the better call of duty games though.In conclussion... Good Game :O\n",
      "So, this game, for me, is somewhat unique.This was one of the first survival/exploration type games that I have owned (unless you include Minecraft, but that doesn't really count.) and, despite the low amount of hours, I have found it quite an enjoyable game. It is incredibly polished for a game in early access, the graphics are great, and the atmosphere is a solid 10/10. You get a real sense of scale, some monsters that may be implemented would be 10, 20 times your size. And the audio in this game. Just wow.If you want to experience this game fully, you definitely would have to have a good pair of headphones, as there is alot to hear, from the roaring of the Reaper Leviathan, (It's scary as it sounds!) to the quiet ping of the Cyclops as you explore the depths of this alien planet.This game can get pretty spooky, as it gets very dark at night, and basically everything is out to kill you. There is even a fish that will swim towards you and explode. Sometimes, it can get prety tense having to swim up from the floor some 60 metres down to the surface with a limited supply of oxygen, though you can craft al osrts of things to assist you in your diving. The map, though, is not randomly generated, but is made by the devs as they produce the game, and the map is large enough so that you feel you are in quite a large ocean planet. To sum upp, Subnautica is a great game, though at the current point in time, is somewhat lacking in content, and I dont feel a reason to come back to it when I leave to go do something else. One thing that would make the game far better as well would be a multiplayer, co-op gamemode so that friends can join you and you can stuff around and do all sorts of things together.Grahpics 8/10Audio 10/10Gameplay 7/10Thank you for reading my review.\n",

Stepping backwards and ignoring previous Saints Row games, Saints Row : The Third is actually a pretty good game. 0.5 comes from the co-op.\n",
      "Incredibly fun game. Airship combat featuring 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 team based gamemodes of Deathmatch and King of The Hill. Frequented by community ambassadors who will teach people anything they need to know, this game is easy to learn but hard to master. Always being updated with new content and bug fixes, and the devs are very active within the player base as well. There are ALWAYS people playing this, so it doesn't matter where you live, you can always find a game to jump into. Most people have microphones too, so don't be afraid to engage in some crew banter to make everyone's jobs easier.If you love being involved in quality teamwork where every person makes a difference, consider picking this game up and playing with your close friends or make some new friends to regularly experience the joy of blowing someone else's ship up.

      "This game is a perfect game for tryhards. Since it involves alot of thinking, your friendly neighbourhood tryhard will look up on the interweb \"Ultimate tic tac toe strategy\". I haven't done it you have no proof. Unfortunatly the game mechanics are too random for your average win strat.We got fading mechanics which are way too realistic for this world, like why do they fade at the most convienient time.Okay so to wrap it all up. Its like tic tac toe meets another game of tic tac toe so that makes 2 sets of tic tac toethen you times it by 4 and plus 1 and there you have it.

      "If you are wondering if this game would be a cute alternatives to games like \"Outlast\" or \"SCP-Containment Breach\", then turn around. This game starts out cute and cuddly, but over time, it will gladly appear behind you and stab the squirming soul out of your very own raw flesh (not literally). I'd even argue that Outlast is less scary than this hell of a game, due to how SHoJS makes you feel comfortable before it chokes you using a meat gutter.I'd say 10/10 for f**king up my sleep.A more detailed review below:Graphics: It has a 1995 3D game style on it, with little amount of curves used for the level's architectureStory: Go in mansion, figure out crap, escape. Simple enough. But you can find more information on the events that occured in the mansion though the CAT-DOS or just general notes.Difficulty: Played SCP-Containment breach? Well, it's kind of like it, except for a few things.Enemies: They start out cute, taking forms of paper cut-outs that jumpscares you thoughout the game. But it gets darker...Characters: Spooky > Elizabeth (Bioshock Infinite). There are also some minor characters that are mentioned through \"notes n' stuff\"Gameplay: A classic round of \"Enter room, leave room\" style of gameplay that does convert itself into \"something else\" later on in the game..Combat: Didn't get there yet. I'll have to ask a friend for this one.Scare factor: Play while sitting in the toilet just in case. (Translation: EXTREMELY SCARY AS IT GOES ON)Music: Title screen is catchyOverall: If you like horror games, buy it. If you don't, get HuniePop or something. I won't judge.\n",
      "Fantastic game by absolutely all means, and if not the best game in the entire Devil May Cry franchise.However, considering this is not on it's original platform, the controls can come off as a bit convoluted. It would be nice if the game were ported and configured to be a bit more PC friendly like the franchise's newest addition.But this aside, DMC3 is definitely my all-time favourite game in the series.The controls are solid, the game feel is fluid, and it's just dang fun to play! I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first. It's only the prequel to events leading up to the rest of the games.Granted DmC Devil May Cry takes the title of complete prequel, Devil May Cry 3 is just the best game in the whole series.\n",

      "This game was one of my genuine favourites, and it still would be if people still played it. There was a peak when you could get a full server within a few seconds, now you will be lucky to get a game at all, I mean REALLY lucky, I envy you! If only this game got more attention. Still I get on now and then and play organised games with friends but it would be great if the community got back together.\n",
      "This game is absolutely amazing, I wish I paid the full price for it because I feel I ripped off the developers when I paid $0.02 for a sturdy, quality, AMAZING, spectacular game. They should ask for more money too and how do I ride the horses? I can't beleive that I've finally found a game as beautiful as this; I bought it for all of my friends and they love it so much too. I bought it for my crush and now I have seven girlfriends. Like wow, why didn't I buy this sooner. Xoxo, much love from Hobbet360\n",

      " 7/10 EDIT: As of the most recent update, there is no loading/setup bugs and the interface has improved significantly. Now has more Australian ping-friendly servers, uses up a lot less CPU.TL;DR: Great visuals, very individual, bit buggy, ♥♥♥♥ community, very unique, WORTH PLAYING!Been playing this game for a while now and I have high hopes for the full-version. The loading times and setup however is pretty ♥♥♥♥-poor. I've spent 16 hours in-game, most of which are probably spent joining servers and loading up the game. The graphics/animations were nice. Original textures and decal, detailed landscapes and maps. Animations are mostly consistent. It has a unique fighting engine, having an anatomical damage-system instead of the normal health based system, like the Overflow indie engine. The physics are a bit off, seeing a lot of bugs and glitches here and there but that's okay for a game still in it's beta stage. Controls were fairly simple, hard to pickup but very satisfying when I got the hand of it. The community at times can be painful to put up with, witnessed first hand on many accounts people taking over servers and changing the game-modes (Free-duels to FFA). Full of obnoxious kids ignoring game rules, leaves me exiting the game frustrated every time. I only bother with higher level servers, although I don't fit that criteria, is the only games that have players who give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the quality of gameplay. I'm sure there will be a more in depth story-line to come in the future, but for now it's not fair to hold the game against it.\n",
      "ok, I love flight sims, but I love them more when they have easily accessible instructions and settings menus.  This sim is possibly the most user unfriendly sim I have ever played.  The Graphics are lovely (as seen speeding skew off a runway and into the buildings!), but I can't recommend it to anyone who is new to sims (or anyone who expects to be able to adjust the sim either in menu- or in game).  I guess its back to the 128 page manual.  Bummer, I am sure It will get easier... at some point.\n",

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!to start off with, if you dont like 2D games, then you sir have no opinion on games. 2D or 3D i love it.Very Good Game! love the story, love the fact that i didnt crash once. 9/10Pros:Story line is very exciting and in depth, didnt once drag on (with the exception of the scanning for objects of course but if you dont have to search for clues then the entier concept of starbound would be ruined, you have to go from planet to planet and that is something that you shouldn't avoid)Crew members are nice to have along with you but you should be able to upgrade them, like add a new type of guy called 'arms dealer' and have him build you guns and then you can mod your crewThis game has a great potential, there could be ship fights, where it goes along the style of FTL where you can repair damage (and then the mechanic can have something else to do) and also fire upon the enemy and teleport onto their ship. there could also be inter dimentional planets where you can build a demention hopper tat can hop in and out of dimentions.adictive as crack (litteraly)Cons:Removed Mech :(They removed my love, mech suits, they were amazing!

The mech in the old game was, underpowered, there should be like rocket launchers and machine guns and a modding station for it, and all this could be powered by some kind of fuel that is hard-ish to make.Recruiting crew members is a pain, needs to be explained a lot more, turns out you have to build a house (or hotel) for people and do missions for them until they go \"welp i love this dude, i want to join his ship\" you should be able to find people in a sticky life or death situation AND then you can gain his trust and friendship (along with the house building)you cant change your worlds, you have one world per game, you should be able to choose a character and then choose a world, not choose a character and get plopped into 1 universe the entier time.Removed the outpost miniquests :(this game is massive and is hard to review in under 10,000 words, but all in all i strongly reccomend this game to people who like terraria and want si-fi jammed down its throat.\n",
      "This game is a clone of Diablo but it does everything much better than Diablo has done in its series! You get to choose from a wide range of roles, you can be anything from an Engineer that operates heavy weapons or a Berserker that deals damage close range and has a high attack speed for all melee weapons. Everyone thinks Diablo is the top dog in rpgs but i beg to differ that Torchlight II has all the right componants that a dungeon crawler should have, it preforms better in everyway such as having a very fresh atmospheric feel to the game unlike Diablo that is just dark and gloomy, pets for you to use in battle and to also take your items back and fourth and to sell them at the shops. This game supports mods and there is a small but active community making them and there is also many people still playing so you can team up with them or get a group of friends together and play on your own server. Overall this game is great and i highly reccomend for anyone who wants to get into the genre.\n",
      "I'm here to tell you a story. A story of a person (named Sebly), who bought a game. Sebly was playing TF2 one day, when he got a call on Skype. It was his good friend GamezBro. Gamez had bought a new game. Gamez said he was installing it at that very second. The game was called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Sebly had a Counter-Strike game. It was called Counter-Strike: Source. But Sebly had hardly ever played it. He had only bought it to fix the textures for Garry's Mod. A few minutes later, a message popped up in the corner of Sebly's screen. It read, 'GamezBro is now playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.' Sebly listened to Gamez as he played Counter-Strike for the first time. Sebly did this for the rest of the day. The next day he listened again. This happened for many days, until it was unbearable. Sebly bought the game. As it installed, Sebly impatiently sat at his computer, as he listened to GamezBro getting owned in a Team Deathmatch. Finally the download was finished. Sebly booted up the game. He started the tutorial (as he always did) and was mid-way through it when he had to go. Sebly miserably shut down his computer.Ok. Now onto the actual review. CS:GO is great. Easy to play, hard to Master. The game is very simple. Terrorists versus Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorists must plant the bomb at either the A or B bombsites, and the Counter-Terrorists must stop them. It feels great to rush into B on Dust II and plant the bomb, or to AWP someone through mid-doors. But the best feeling comes when you: Headshot someone from far away with and AK. Get 2 or more kills with a single bullet. Watch the CTs run around looking for the strategically placed bomb.  Get 2 knife kills in a row etc. There's a different feeling when you trade one of the many skins that are available in the game. The item system in the game is genius. You can find gun skins or weapons crates (which can be unlocked with a key), after a game is finished, which you can then trade. You can even put stickers on the guns :D.This game is a must-have. If you dont have it get it. 1000/10Thx for reading. Sebly.\n",

      "So, i told a friend about Portal Stories: Mel, and she decided to get both Portals plus this. She has played maybe 10 mins on each apart from portal 2 of which she is going through the co-op with me, and she says she doesn't enjoy the portal game series... This is a direct Quote: \"I'm stuck on portal 1, i'm playing portal 2 with you and portal 3 is all about going down a stupid giant lift\"So 11/10 to Portal Stories: Mel for not only really making me think about the tests, but also for being \"Portal 3\"......\n",
      "Basically the Hunger Games in a video game. I personally love the hunger games movies alot so I tried this game and overall it is a fun game to play solo, or with friends. 9/10http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719789702http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719554205Pros - The game play is fun and it takes no more than minutes for each match to start.        - You can craft different things such as traps and weapons        - It has its moments of funny humorCons - It has only one map to play on and that map is basically a forest with builldings-  There isnt a load of weapons- Character customization is very limited\n",
      "The game, alike its brethren endless space, has stunning graphics however it is styled in 8-16 bit, i.e. the game keeps style with the old bit-like games but does not look completely like an old cartridge game. The game play is surprisingly smooth and easy to understand but the game gives quite the challenge regardless what character you have or how skilled you are. Every level and play through you will have to think strategically and place defences so, you also have to keep a constant watch on your hero's life as well make sure that your producers are all equal or close in production or focus mostly on one type. As you traverse through the seeming less endless floors, every item that you get holds a big value even if it is a stray jacket.There are a few glitches left in the game but all are being fixed quite constantly by a very active dev team which are probably the most friendly dev team you will ever come across and the community, even friendlier.The music is done by FlyByNo, the musician for the well known endless space, has again created more masterpieces. The music in this game is very well thought out as the music does not make you have to battle with it in order to think of strategies rather it helps you, while setting the mood and vibe very well. The calm music, slow paced and thought inventiveness is what makes the entire game so relaxing most of the time yet so frantic at others.The multiplayer, however, is still having difficulties but has only recently been released so is technically in beta still. The multiplayer, regardless of your upload speeds/download speeds, has a big lag problem which is getting much better slowly over time as it isn't amplitudes forte but they have worked with multiplayer on turn a based game before.At first glance the game looks entirely turn based, D.o.t.E. is part turn based, part strategy and part real time, the turn based comes from the doors and the material obtaining being that each 'turn' is counted in doors. The strategy is obvious, planning where you will go and where certain things go along with the difficult choice of weather \"should I have all defence in here or make it a place for my hero's to heal...or both?\" will be asked about in every room that becomes available to you to place defences an the such. There is more strategy in the characters as well, as you will have to plan who gets what and who should have what role which becomes even larger and harder to do in multiplayer (more on that later), in fact you even have to plan your escape. Finally the real time comes down to doing all of the above whilst being attacked, placing defences, watching your health, equipping items, you name it, you can do it in real time when the waves of monsters are out.multiplayer doesn't only have problems with lag or randomly disconnecting but also somewhat in communication and majorly in sharing items. When there is an item no one knows what the chest holds so no one knows what the item is until they pick it up, once the item is picked up, instead of the item going into the global inventory it goes into the personal inventory which if you cant equip the said item for any reason, you cant drop it nor trade it in any way. This makes the game more difficult as loot gives more bonuses and traits than levelling meaning your entire team is more likely to die unless you all get lucky.Next problem is communication, due to the lag building things and claiming a room becomes more difficult as more than one person may try building/claiming at once. The only way around this currently is to let the host of the server to build/claim, meaning your entire team will depend on you if you are the host.All up the game is well balanced, not pain numbingly boring, even after a few plays, and looks very good for its chosen style.great graphics design: + + +smooth controls: + +very easily understandable: + + +simple tutorial: -+ +awesomely challenging: ++ +extremely well balanced: ++ +multi-genre: +++active devs: +extremely friendly devs: ++ +extremely friendly community: ++ +perfect music: +++ +multiplayer: +very laggy/disconnecting multiplayer: - ---very interesting mechanics: + + +mutiplayer inventory problem: --muliplayer communication problem: -34 pro's8 con'stotal: 28 pro'sn=number of cons/pros totala=answer+/- depends on cons majority (-) or pros majority (+)0.16666666666666666666666666666667*n=a +/- 50.16666666666666666666666666666667*26=4.3333333333333333333333333333334+5=9.33333333333333333333333333333349.3/10______________________________if the mutiplayer was fully fixed and the tutoral a bit more advanced i.e. more interactive it would be a 10/10\n",

      "Stabbed my friends, survived several gunshots to the chest with absolutely no repercussions, convinced my entire town that I was a Doctor, ended up having to stab them all too.Then I played Town of Salem, quite the fun game.In case you were wondering, the game sees an average of a thousand people on at any given time, so there's no trouble finding a lobby to play with at all. (There's no voice or video chat, though, only text.)On a more serious note, Town of Salem is a really fun game about deception and stabbing people overnight. It is very similar to the party game Mafia (but without any useless roles that do nothing).You can try it over at http://www.blankmediagames.com if you want.The Steam version comes with $5 in points and a more stable experience.Also, you can fund the devs (a worthy cause).\n",
      "Great game and all, but it is possibly the worst game to play at the start, it provides next to no help with starting out and if you don't know someone who already plays this game you might as well just quit because it is the most unfriendly new-user game in the history of steam.\n",

      "Single player is awesome. Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥. If you think its going to be an avp2 experience, look away my friends, look away.Predators are overpowered. Expect games where predators outnumber both aliens AND marines combined. Not as rare as one might think.You might be thinking \"Oh, i'll be going alien, surely since its a melee only class i must have an advantage in close combat, or at the very least, a teeny tiny advantage.\" HAHAHAHAHA!Nice balance.The entire combat premise of this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing rock-paper-scissors farcical. Light attack beats heavy, block beats light and heavy beat block.As expected, heavy does more damage + has a longer casting animaton. BUT, you can actually CANCEL the animation by blocking! So you can make it look like you're going to heavy attack, and then immediately transition to a block! WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES THIS EXIST?What is the ♥♥♥♥ing point of creating a rock-paper-scissors mechanic if you are going to radically change the entire god damn premise of it?The previous avp games were filled with intense fast paced multiplayer action! And this one is just, disappointing. If you are going to have a rock-paper-scissors combat, ♥♥♥♥ing do it properly! God!\n",
      "After wasting my life playing this game for several days worth, I still have no intention of stopping as this is a fantastic game. Like all games, there are good things and bad things. The bad things in this are occassionally hackers, matchmaking waiting times, slow servers, and bugs that are not game breaking, but annoying, and also the occasional ungrounded hackusation (mostly from people that don't understand the game). The good things far outweigh the bad. The community is very friendly and rarely toxic, maps are detailed and destructable, gunplay is usually tight, the game is tactically inclined, no running and gunning like CoD, rounds are short, gameplay is often completely different each round, etc. etc.It's not a perfect game, but it is very very good. 8.5/10.\n",

      "Starbound is a stunning and fun game that is easy to learn and play by yourself, or even with others.You can choose your race and customise the appearance of your character. You are spawned in a random planet that is chosen by the computer from a variety of worlds.Similar to Terraria, you have to scavenge for supplies, weapons, and resourses to build a home and live in a safe, friendly environment. Except in Starbound you don't live on just one planet for the whole time.You can gather fuel such as xoal for your ship to run, and take you to a new, and completely different planet filled with totoally new generated caves, enemies, dungeons and many more.As Starbound is still in Early Access, i think the directors of this games have done and outstanding job so far. I think this game deserves a 8.5/10 based on the early access stage.\n",

      "I recommend more people play this game. If you want that survival of the fitest feeling I recommend you and at least 3 friends and play the \"hunted\" game mode on the \"Barlowe\" map and pu the difficulty on \"extreme\", this will make zombies stronger   and will allow them to kill you in two hits, also when you shoot all the zombies on the map will go for you and it'll give away your position to the other players trying to kill you so it will make you think more before you shoot, other players can set off your phone by using their own but only when they are close to you. If you follow these steps you'll have a terrifying experience.\n",
      "Rarely play driving games, and when I do it's full of excitement, crashes and little to no realism.So I went into this expecting kind of a boring experience, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of detail and effort put into it. It's like everything I could have a gripe with is optional, or not even a problem.Fines aren't horrible unless you deliberately try and rack them up. Parking a trailer can be a challenge, but you can skip it if you're low on time/can't be bothered. Worried about fatigue ruining the experience? Turn it off, sleep's for the weak anyway.The map is massive, the environment's lovely, and the controls are tight.On top of that, it's mod-friendly, and any traffic you back up from a prang won't scream obscenities about your mum.10/10.\n",
      "Ark is a awesome game to play with friends, for being in it's Beta/Alpha stages it is a good catch. There are also bad things in ARK which I think should be changed or deleted.First off the good things. What I like about ARK is it's open sandbox. You can go around exploring the island that you have been stranded in and discover new things. Another I like about ARK is the gameplay. Taming dinosaurs, raiding, hunting, the number of things go on. It gives a big viarity of things to do, especially the big range of dinosaurs you can tame which more are being added by the minute. Another thing I like is the constant updates. The developers seems to update the game a lot and add new content such as new dinosaurs and weapons and much more. Now the things I don't like. First off raiding, it seems to be too easy for people who have grenades to destroy and raid bases in an instant. Even the dinosaurs inside can't stop them. I think they should give defenders the upper hand in the battle for a base, because no one likes to rebuild their base every day. One thing I think they should work on is a bit of optimization on a game. Most people can't run ARK at all, and quite a bit of people run the game but have bad FPS. I don't see anything else bad about this game. Just the two optimizations and raiding. I really do recommend getting this game to help out the develpovers make this game ever better then it is right now. And hey! Make a review like I've done so they know what they need to work on/add. \n",
      "Played the beta and haven't played full release yet, so review is based on that.The game in a nutshell- hire mercenaries of many classes. Create a party of 4 to descend into some dark and horrific dungeon. Use the many abilities of the various classes to defeat your foes, collect treasure. Cry when your favourite hero dies. Use loots to upgrade town, improve heroes and delve in again.The different classes for heroes mean there is lots of different ways to create a party. Some classes are about straight up damage. Others are better at using damage over time effects (lower damage, but they stack AND bypass defences, but can be resisted). Some classes used a \"mark\" mechanic, marking an enemy and doing no damage, but in turn allowing powerful abilities or bonus damage on that enemy. There are CC based classes too. However the evil that dwells in the dark is merciless. You will lose heroes. Some will go crazy and wander off. Others can have so many negative traits as to be unusable.Combat is part RNG, part skill and part risk-vs-reward. Like your party is low on health, the next room is your last and it's a treasure room. You could forfeit the completion bonus but keep your heroes. Or you could fight the monsters and pray for a win. Just like in life though, sometimes things just don't go your way. Sometimes everything goes your way, but when things go bad, you(r heroes) hurt.Not only that but throughout the dungeon morale is slowly chipped away. Bad news if it drops too much, a masochistic hero that refuses a heal could well spell the end of your expedition.Be well friend, and come prepared to face the evil that lurks in the Darkest Darkness.\n",

      "I freakin' love this. Great pictures, great storylines(yes, storylines), great soundtrack, and many choices that await just around the corner. It's one of those games where choices REALLY matter and you have to make sure to pick the right ones. Although, there's no way of telling whether the choices you made were good or bad until the ending. Another thing: this game likes to stick to your mind. Like, really stick. You'll go to bed later on wondering what you could've done better and weeping with a broken heart because you got seperated from a character in the game which you felt something for, or you could have a smile on your face because you're with someone you really like and got the good end with them. Honestly, this game has made me feel things i've never felt before - e.g: Inspiration, saudade, love, depression... It's really touching. This game has taught me a few things, and I abide by them to this day. It's changed my perspective on things, how I act, what to do in situations, and I even managed to gain myself a girlfriend :DI highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.

All in all an OK game if you enjot basketball otherwise not great.\n",
      "Warframe is a great game. They created a 3rd person shooter unlike any other. The amount of weapons, pets and warframes (suits) is fenomanel and you can get almost everything for free.So first I'll tell you the negatives. This is a game where you will need to hide behind cover but there is no proper cover system witch is a big problem. At first it may be hard to adjusting to having to crouch behind objects and move out of cover to shoot people but it is easy to get used too. The great thing is once your character ranks up a bit this becomes less and less of a problem.I would suggest playing this game while it's free because it's going to become a full game (is in beta at the moment) and so this may add a price tag. Premium is something that can really make things easier but i don't suggest getting it because buyihng stuff always seems to be a waste.The extensive amount of stuff is another thing. While there are about 14 warframes (suits) which are all completely different some a really overpowered and others underpowered, it doesn't work. The overpowered ones are hard to get and underpowered ones you start with (the best starting warframe is Loki btw) (second best is excalibre.I recommend buying blueprints for everything because their so much cheaper the only issue is you have to wait to build stuff and you have to collect items. Sentinels are really overpowered and bad for stealth (unless you get the one for stealth). They are basically pets and shoot enemies for you.All around this is an awesome game with great gameplay it just has a couple of flaws. If you have enough friends to play with it can be very addictive but if you don't have any friends that are interested don't bother playing it because this game is made for multiplayer.\n",
      "Hours played before Steam release: about 11.5I was quiet against this title when it was first announced. I'd been burnt very very hard by the original farce that was War Z,Survivor Stories and  finally Romeo's Aftermath. (Bought multiple copies for friends thinking it was going to be great yup wont get into but Sergey T I still have negative feeling towards you and your previuos history).I was finally swayed after watching a vid released by the lead dev in which he addressed War Z, development, pay2win etc etc. So layed down some coin, grabbed a copy and jumped in to find  American, European and Asian based servers no Oceanic servers and being an Australian gamer Oceanic servers are a benefit and straight away I knew there would be issues, its a PvP game and playing on 200+ ping servers is going to be a major issue for hit detection etc. and it proved to be an issue. Especially when encountering large groups of angry killers in a city settings and really effect the PvP experience to to extent where have been reluctant to go into servers with more then 10-15 players making the game a boring PvE bug hunt and loot run.The lack of Oceanic servers has also hindered grouping up with fellow players in the region maybe when the friends systems is fixed a group scenario may overcome the deficincies of server locations.Graphics where also something to get used to. The inhouse enginge and its graphics renderings didn't look like a game released in 2016. Sorry but they look something a par with an early 2000's release game with very a very chunky feel. Nvidia control panel has helped in forcing AA and some other tweaks to improve things but on a whole they are still low grade. in saying this though I have read that there are gaphics improvements incoming with future updates so will see what happens. (got a couple screewn shots up in my profile).The Map....... The built up areas, be it the Cities,airfields or contruction sites are well made and thought out and make for some great areas for firefights BUT I find it too small for some reason. Can't explain it, just yup feels small and hemmed in sometimes.Loot,loot and more loot. Its easy to find guns and ammo. In fact its easy to find most basic items. As you rank up better loot ( go figure). Had fun doing runs to find specail weapons only to loose them quickly (refer to PvP servers grrrr).Guns seems to handle okay BUT server lag etc does effect them with hit reg. So how do I feel, would I recomend it to my friends..... Not until theres Oceanic Servers.It is a PvP game and having to battle not just your opponent but server lag, ping issues, desync and hitbox reg isues takes the fun away and i want to have fun with this game. I can get used to the funny looking graphics and feelings on the map size but can deal with issues listed above. If and when we get Oceanic servers I will relook at my reommendation.Well they have supplied us with Oceanic servers but the dev's like with their past track record have stuffed the game.This title was origanlly advertised as a Survival MMO and now they are scrapping the entire survival part and just letting the game become another generic loot based PvP FPS. Just another crap FPS title\n",
      "My world, was a dark void. I had nothing, knew nothing. I felt my will slip away, each and every day. What was life? What.. what was I here for.

But there was a shining light in my life. Something that I'd almost overlooked ever since my world started to ruin. Something inside me made me stop. I dropped the gun, dropped the pills and ran from the kitchen. Through the living room, and past the hallway towards my room. I slowed to a stop as I reached my computer. I turned on the computer and logged on...I opened Skype to check if my best friend had replied and said he'd talk to me again, let me have my girlfriend back, pay for my car that he broke and convince my parents to accept me again.My eyes glanced over the page hopefuly then drifted to the bottom. \"You're a ♥♥♥♥wad who plays Warframe all day. Get a life.\"I sat down on my chair and let out a sigh. I lost my job, my friends, my girlfriend, my parents, my life...The only thing I had left was Warframe.Then again, Warframe made me lose my job, my friends, my girlfriend, my parents AND my life.Eh.Warframe was the best game I ever played. Thank you <3\n",

      "Not a big review guy but all the negative review, I feel like I should review my opinions.Specs:2x980ti (was not using SLI during this time)i7-6770k running at the retail clockspeed of 4Ghz32GB DDR4 RAMRunning the game at max settings on a 3440x1440 ultrawide monitorProformance:I do go down to around 40ish frames for a couple of seconds now and then, nothing that will ruin my fun.Most of the time I checked, I was above 70FPS. So the proformance for me was no issue, not saying that the game doesn't have issues. Just I don'tStarting out:I started out on a planet that was a bit hard to move around with all its \"lumpyness\". This did make it a bit harder for me to gather what I needed to repair my ship and get stared.Ship up and running:Once I was able to fly I stuck to the same planet, just to explore waypoints, I never read much about this game and I thought there was limited waypoints, THERE IS A POOP TON! So around this time I was finding Knowledge stones to learn languages to communicate to the NPCs. My friend reminded me that if I discover all the creatures on the planet I get a big credit reward. So I did that.Leaving the planet:I got all the creatures, claimed my 225,000 credit reward and wen't to the next planet in the solar system to discover those. I traveled, met NPCs and used my language knowledge to give them what they want and get rewarded for doing so. I explored waypoints, upgreaded bag slots and bought new multitools and kept on upgrading. But my main focus was language and creatures! So I explored for almost 4 hours now and I am still on the first solar system, There is 4 planets and 1 moon. I am on my last planet, then I want to go travel to another system. Did it live up to my expectations?:I was not apart of the hype train, I first saw the game years ago and decided that I might get it, All the news, all he hype building. I stayed away from, I made myself think this game is going to fail. The day before it releases I buy it and play it as soon as its out, I enjoy it and it beats my expectations! I am just still starting out and I have not left my system yet! I already got 5 hours of playtime! What dissapointed me about the game?:The flying was not what I expected, I would reccoment using a controller, but even then it isn't the best.\n",

      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we1abilRUEoHitman is keeping truer to its roots than the previous installasion, Absolution.This isnt a classic experience, like Blood Money was but it sure as hell is fun.There is only one level released per month which to many consumers is a disappointment, to myself even, but this presents a reason fo rme to revisit this game with a refreshing appeal when I am inbetween genres of the backlogs in my current library. Once a month to spend a good week or two fleshing out all the remaining variables and possibilities in a new episode is a gimmick that works for me. I wont play this game out through and through before returning to another game like Arma or Rainbow Six Siege with friends and forgetting about this gem.There is contoller support if that suits your fancy but keyboard and mouse gets the job done. Theres been many a bug but overall as an experience it's been a pleasant one.Would I recommend this to new players to teh hitman franchise, NO.I would however recommend it to returning players who want to see IO Interactive compensate for their previous installation, Absolution.For Hitman vets, one stage or all regardless, this is a must have game that emulates the classic hitman experience as best it can.\n",
      "Don't know enough about this yet to make a decision?Its a top down styled rts which has features a akin to that of games like Commandos 3. Variable camera angles and the ability to take command of your soldier individually or a vehicles and correct its aim for better accuracy in exchange for a loss of perspective on the larger scale battle. This is where Command and Conquer meets Commandos with a squirt of Company of Heroes. If you like games like ARMA 3 and Company of Heros this is the hybrid for you. It literally feels like you were to put Commandos' character contol into the engine of Company of Heroes within the evironment of the Arma 3 RHS mod. Some of the more intimate character commands are a but tricky and less responsive than to be desired but for it's current state ad an easrly access feature it has enough controlability and content, not to mention the already growing Workshot Content, to warrant several hours worth of addictive gameplay per session. As someone completely new to the franchise, this is a refreshing game with a unique mili-sim / sector control / conquest / survival cornerstone to its foundation. Worth the money to pay for it in its current state. As mentioned there are bugs and some frustrating mechanics for individual unit functions but we can only hope they will be smoothened out. == pro's & cons ==My biggest con about the game  is that this may not be for friends who live far apart to play together. When I was uploading to my youtube channel whilst playing this my entire lobby suffered lag that would cause the game to stop momentarily, quite often, when my ping surpassed 350ms. When not uploading and having enough free bandwidth to keep my ping below 80ms there were no issues. I havent tested any further ranges of ping between.My biggest pro woul dbe that to play this with your friends is one of the most interesting and engaging games to participate in as a team. Roles can be given or you can just play it your own way. Theres are so many playstyle possibilites for this. You can choose to just control a small group of specialists and leave the rest of the companies within your force to be managed by your team mates or you can choose to have a little bit of everything. Do you prefer to play the sniper elite or the vehicle company or do you want to play them all?I reccommend this game, for its target audience; which would be people who want a milisim / rts  or as close as they can get to it.\n",
      "So far so good. I didnt find any bugs. Not to say that they dont exist but there is seemingly only little content in the game itself at this stage; enough content to keep you entertained and to grind away learning what you can and cannot do but not enough content to really notice something not doing what you would expect it to.I didnt manage to craft a shelter like in the video, which is something I am keen to discover. The idea behind th egame has so much potential, with a multiplayer/coop addon I would really reap the most out of a game like this, trying to survive with a friend. There is currently no non-environmental enemies, and I dont see a reason that there should be any.Hours could easily be lost disovering new things with future updates. This is a good submission from a team of 2 local developers. I would endorse this game being worth its price in its current state, although not for everyone. People who liked the arma 2/3 epoch mods for its exploration and building will enjoy something like this. __Found my way to the closest island. Very lucky I didnt press the wrong key while paddling and throw it away.Made a campfire, cooked a crab. Found some duck tape, coulndt find a use. Drank some coconut ♥♥♥♥ and made a stone axe.Paddled to the next nearest island. Found a shipwreck on the way. Found items in the shipwreck but my inventory was full. I got greedy and I drowned. This wouldnt have ever happened if I wasnt drinking flaming martini's with the pilot.___\n",
      "This game is an incredible time killer. Suitable for a casual flick through when you are waiting for a buddy to finish a lobby or waiting for a friend to come online. Beware, thinknig of settling for a few minutes of casual playing can soon become an hour or two spent trying to better your reaction and eye for detail.If you suffer from OCD you will thouroughly enjoy this little gem.\n",

      "Hey all my friends and others, I don't recommand games too often but this is HIGHLY recommanded on my list if you love horde games (Also if you love L4D this is a must buy.) It's melee combat is awesome, loot drops, crafting system for different melee/range weapon to change up the horde system. I been playing the beta today and oh my god I sunk so many hours already. Anyways I give this game an 7/10 opitimzing need fixing (The dev said they will fix that when it releases so hopfully they go though with it.) But that all fokes, review will change when it out of beta depend for better or the worse. Loving this game!\n",
      "'This be brilliant! Although I've spent only a matter of hours playing this cartoony, first person shooter,I've already deemed it to be my fav fps non puzzle game I've ever played! It has an outstanding online multiplayer, cool cartroony visuals and a greaty community! I suggest you go on the store and download this free to play, non catch game now!'I made this review aboout 11 months ago when I had only about 7 hours of experience, so I think I should update that now I'm almost at the 1000 milestone. This first-person-shooter looks like (from what I could tell) recieved quite a bit of hype with all the trailers and pictures uploaded onto the internet before release, which doesn't really change how the game will turn out but hype is generally a good thing. Before I got this game however, two years ago, my friend Qwertycoxy introduced it to me, and my thoughts were generally positive, but I really wasn't sure what I was doing exactly or the character's different attributes so I left thinking 'That was alright, but I would want more practice on it before I make a judgement' When I downloaded this game back in Feb 2013, I had little experience with the FPS genre so going into this was like trying something new while knowing the basics of it before hand. As months went on, I really got into things and I really started to enjoy the game as a whole. I began to learn the pricing systems which would later help me out quite a bit and my friend Ham introduced me to all these different fan-made game modes and even little minigames in those game-modes. Eventually I managed to unbox an Unusual which is without a doubt my highlight of the game so far. Anyway, the simpleness in the characters' abilities and the like really can be welcoming to new players and the like. I absolutely love the soundtrack to this game even though most tracks are only really featured in Valve-made Source Film Maker videos. I also adore the humour in item descriptions (official ones not so much the ones with a description tag used on) and the items themselves! These items really have their charm and I have to congratulate the community items that have made it into the game. I believe that this is a FANTASTIC game in every way possible (except the sparys but thats not just a TF2 problem) and I hope to still get hours of enjoyment out of it with all my friends!\n",

      "the game is fun with your friend. i Bought this one when it come out and start to get boring because noone else can play with. Now it is f2p, with more player, new game mechanics, looking great but the thing is the game is buggy as hell...for some part. Like i try to choose this monster but the game decide for itself and change the monster i want(the same goes with hunter). Another one when player quit or afk an A.I will replace them(the thing is A.I is really dumb last time i check) and when player quit, no player will join the game to replace it. The last one is the most annoying despite the 1st, like when you found some buddy in your match, the round end, the game switch to new game which will force me to leave the game and auto finding new player. TR please fix ( I know it is still on Beta Stage but at least make the game seem to be \"playable\"),P/s: Please bring back the mode Player vs A.I\n",
      "Let me just start off saying that this game has Stamper as the narrator, and if you dont know who this person is then you need to youtube him... Awesome co-op game to play together with friends, or even on your own. Love the set challenges in each level where you have to collect a certain amount of green gems, golden yarn and complete it in a set time. Story is actually a sad one if you look past all the joking around and stuff ;-; Hatty ;-;\n",
      "Magcika is the best mage game around with witty jokes and a smart story with ridiculously huge range range of spells for you to cast at your will. Although the game gets unrelentingly hard at times so its a must with friends.\n",
      "An enjoyable game but not a great game. Is it worth US$20? No. Half that? Maybe. The game itself is a unique (when's the last time you played as a baby?) first person horror/puzzle game though the puzzles aren't difficult and the horror aspects aren't that scary (or more acurately, life theatening). While the game was enjoyable it's not going to be one of those horror games that you'll get your friends over to play, there are other horror games better suited to that. At only 3 hours it's over quite quickly with no replayability apart from ensuring that you grab all of the achievements. Speaking of which, the four achievements are easy to achieve so it's a good game for the completionists.NOTE TO STEAMOS PLAYERS: It claims full controller support though on Steam OS 2.0 Preview (@ 20/07/2015) using an XBOX 360 controller it was not playable due to controller issues (appears that the mappings were wrong, cannot change settings in game so stuck with non-performing controller).TL;DR - Grab it when it's greater than 50% off as there is an enjoyable game here, though it'll last only 3 hours as there's no replayability.\n",
      "Wow. WTF did I just play. In short, don't bother.[MILD SPOILERS]There is no game here as there's no actual choices being made. You 'play' as Nina, who has never had a boyfriend and never had sex who falls for someone on an MMORPG who has also never had a girlfriend and never had sex. You basically listen to them VOIP and watch a few short movies. The game is over within an hour. There was no way to change any outcomes and the 'game' that you're forced to play was a grind (and not in an ironic MMORPG way). I would have TK'ed him if the server rules allowed it.Super indie, super boring, super quick and for US$8.99 full price (though I snagged it for US$1 in the humble bundle) it is way overpriced.I could be harsher though I'm holding myself back here.\n",
      "Orion: Dino Horde is a big improvement on Orion: Dino Beatdown and is great to play. Many people buy games like this to play with their friends and such, but this game is great with and without friends. There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Great game to play with friends, ♥♥♥♥ by yourself though. I recommend joining a realisim unit or a group of peeps who play this often, so you can get the most fun out of it.you also may want to consider to buy the DLC bundle for maximum DLC and freedom euphoria.Getting a new PC just for this game.A GTX 970 will do it! (hopefully)10/10 would buy all the DLC and shizz.P.S. you need a good rig to make this game look amazing, otherwise it's pretty standard.\n",
      "(This is all based on my own OPINION)Dark Souls 3 is a Hard game, that breaks off then the easy RPG.It never tells you were to go, and it sure as hell doesn't give you an easy time when you get to the place you need to be. When I first started playing, it took me around 3 Hours to actually defeat (STARTING BOSS SPOILERS AHEAD) Ludex Gundyr, and Vordt, then make it over to the next area, I think I made 3-4 different characters to defeat Ludex, because I needed those Firebombs to kill Ludex Gundyr, thankfully. My friend(s) started to help me through the game once I got near the First Lord of Cinder, I've completed the game over 7 times now, I'm always trying different builds and seeing if I enjoy it or not.Most of my play time now, instead of trying to complete the game again, is helping out other players, and PvPing. (And praising that I don't get into a fight club) Some people you find are fun to play with. Constantly chucking down \"Hello\" Carvings, and doing Gestures, Whilst others don't even Gesture before going into a Boss Fog, or slicing you to Death.A few times I've gotten a good laugh out of some people. I was once invaded someone, and they looked like a Phantom (Due to using a Ring) I waited a bit nearbye, and then walked over, he did a Gesture to look like he was Resting at the Bonfire, he Waved. I did \"My Thanks!\", I used the Bloodlust Katana to stab myself, and rest. Whilst doing that. I realised that the Bonfire wasn't lit, so I wanted to be kind, and wait for the Host to come. He constantly pointed at the Unlit bonfire, and so did I. He brang out his Bloodlust Katana and started to stab himself to do Death. I clapped constantly, he kept going, and killed himself, a moment later. I see on my Screen \"Host of Embers Destroyed!\"(TL;DR/etc. Is)Pros-Semi-Long game-Different to other RPG's-Tries very hard to keep secrets to other Areas-Hard game-Allows for all different kind of Playstyles.-Doesn't matter what Class you select at the near-end game once you've found most things.-Community is (most of the time) fun/funny to play with.-The Community is happy to help each other out (most of the time)-Addicting if you like the game itself-etc.Cons-Some OP weapons-Some Bugs that can pretty much one Hit something that can be Reposited-(For some people) the game not telling them to go can lead to frustration-Starting players will try to kill everything in there path, leading to the annoyance of dying to things much more powerful then you-(For some people) It is easy to not do one thing right, and that will lead to your Death-etc.Thanks for reading my Review.

      " Hearts of Iron III is a Grand-Strategy game based in WW2 to the start of the cold war, to be more specific, 1936 - 1948, it was developed & Published by Paradox Interactive and personally is a spectacular Grand-Strategy.Hearts of Iron III (HOI3) is an educational, engaging and in-depth experience, it allows you to micro-manage every aspect of your military (Army, Aviation & Navy), politics, industry, espionage and more, however if you do not wish to be engulfed with all of these aspects, the AI can take over for you.HOI3 allows for countless do-overs and often answers the \"What if?\" questions comically or quite grimly, it has countless events that allow you to make choices about your nation, such as limiting parties or getting completly rid of a party and other events such as illegal acts.HOI3 also allows you to invade other countries though your military, yes, but also through your diplomacy and espionage, do you want to stop Nazi Germany from getting far at all? Then send it spies to ruin their party and make other parties more strong, however good luck with that. :)If you wish to have a friend to play with, you're able to do that, however be aware that the servers are not up anymore and you will be forced to host your own server through port-fowarding or using a program such as Hamachi, playing online is very interesting and is often more difficult due to the AI sometimes being very predictable.The game does suffer from bugs, game crashes and HUD bugs are very common and get worse the longer you play for one session. If the game does not even launch, it is often Steam or your system and a reinstall is very handy. Game crashes seem to get worse the longer you use a constant game copy, reinstalling this game every time crashes become common is a good idea and modding the game can also cause crashes, however I would reccomend the WW1 mod.I full-heartly reccomend this amazing game, with over 600 hours on Steam and much more off Steam, it helped me learn more in-depth about World War 2 and made me truly see the effects of the war. 9/10+Unique game with much replayability+ Extremly In-depth if you want it to be+ Able to attack a country through unique ways+ Great moding community with WW1 mods to game enhancing mods such as ICE-  Bugs, often forcing a reinstall after a unknown period of time- No official servers\n",
      "Kill things with lightning, kill things with the 7 things that aren't lightning, freeze your friends, summon rocks to shatter your friends, ignore their pleas for you to revive them!Magicka is a game with water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth and fire. Now obviously summoning cold and water makes ice, or summoning fire and water makes steam, but you can make a life beam with water infused into it, healing and wetting your friends and making them succeptable to zapping them with special abilities like steam, lightning, arcane, lightning to do 15,000 damage!Now, this isn't just a game where you can kill your friends - there's a story where everyone speaks all bouncy and you can kill all the NPCs with crazy combos that do varying amounts of damage and it's kind of tricky to get them right. But that's for singleplayer; if you have friends you will literally want to kill them, kill them and then feel better.Ruin everything - Magicka.\n",

      "40 hours in a single game and despite my federation covering about 50% of the galaxy with our combined borders, and every empire not within the federation being a vassal of either myself (mostly) or one of the other members, THERE WAS STILL NO VICTORY! I literally couldn't declare war on anybody and if I wanted to leave my federation to take over the other members, I'd need to wait a 10 year truce...There is a lot wrong with this game, but I think it boils down to 2 main points. The AI is as dumb as a doorknob There is barely any contentThe AI:So often there are AI ships stuck in a system not moving anywhere, even when that empire is under immediate threat. If you click on the fleet, it will show that it is beginning to warp to another system, but then tries to warp to a different one, and it sits there flipflopping between the two. I managed to defeat my first major battle, despite me being severly underpowered, because I exploted this by attacking two systems on either side of the empires main fleet.When you declare war, every other empire within your control (including allys), \"look to you for wisdom\". By that, they turn your highest \"power\" fleet into a deathball by following it with their entire army. This is so moronic that even if the enemies begin bombarding their planets, their main fleet will still follow you around like they are on a leash.Now, this is helpful in some circumstances. You can take out some much more powerful enemies when you have a few empires worth of ships all attacking the same target, but come on, it would have made much more sense to split up and attack some different targets, especially in the end game when you outpower everything.God forbid, if you decide to join a Federation with your Alliance. It works by giving each member a 5 year turn at being leader. They get to choose who to go to war with and what the demands will be in the case of victory. When it came my turn I found myself declaring war on 4 lesser empires just so we would still be at war for at least part of their turn, because in the 100 or so years that I was in a Federation, I think we declared war on two other empires, and had them declare war once on us. In all 3 circumstances, the AI leader would set the demands to liberate a few enemy planets. The problem with this is that the liberated planets still take a lot of work to befriend, so it's usually easier to just declare war on them and cede them like the AI should have done in the first place. Liberating planets is literally the dumbest move you could do in your war demands as it just prolongs an already severly drawn out game.The Content:I probably spent 2/3 of this game on the fastest speed setting, AFK, as I waited for things to happen.The first few hours of the game are pretty interesting, your borders are under immediate threat and you have a lot to get done, but after that, basically nothing can threaten you.There are a few quests that pop up, and an alien race will invade at some point, but they are few and far between and even the few that I did get were pretty much bugged and uncompletable.A game where I sit around waiting for things to happen (and I can't make things happen because the terrible AI doesn't know how to control a federation when it's their turn) is not fun to play at all.All in all, this game feels like it should have been early access and given another few months for playtesters to give the devs something to work on.\n",
      "My Captain Shield was emotionally unstable yet I found myself with a satisfying ending. GG WM (Well Made). 5/5^ and that is the tl;dr of my review.Combat (Captain Mode) 5/5Captain mode is the Normal mode for this game. Out of 2 playthroughs (twice thru the 1st arc, and once thru the second arc), I can say I had no great issues. The last fight in the 1st arc was a fun challenge. Gameplay changes quite a lot depending on your unit investments (you spend cash earnt from scrapping enemies on weapon damage, accuracy, energy usage, HP, EP, and more). I usually set up my ship to fire two rounds of kinetics per turn. In the second arc, there are two battles which will feel impossible (and will be if you don't have the support units for it). The 1st difficult fight (in the second arc) is one of the three side missions. Do the other two first to rack in the cash. Then you can beat this side mission with enough game knowledge. The second hard mission, is just that there are TOO MANY ENEMIES! I mean seriously, TOO MANY ENEMIES JUST TO AMBUSH ONE CARGO SHIP! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BLOODY SHIP! Honestly though, the combat is fun. There are also 6 difficulty options that you can change in game, so if you get stuck on a mission, you have an easy way out. Or if it's to easy for the master tactician, then you can go be a flippin' space whale.Characters - 4.5/5Potential Waifus are all great. If you aren't happy with any of them, ask for a refun- Oh wait, it's free. Free Waifu is good Waifu.Seriously though, from justice loving, to perverted, to tsundere, to childhood friend, to shy, to patriot, and all the way to \"I only live to fight\"; You have a large variety of waifu candidates.Story - 4.5/5*Prologue Spoilers*You're a Captain who's just minding your own business, testing out a prototype ship (welcome to Mass Effect, the VN. Comes with extra waifus), when the USSR invades. Nah, just kidding. It's just a lot of angry people being told that they should be angry at everything, and to vent that anger by shooting space lasers and rail guns at everything that isn't them. So, after a massive capital ship called Legion singlehandedly rips apart your local fleet, it then nukes your capital city. Obviously, you can either die fighting or live to fight another day, so you run for your mfern life. Then you gather allies (waifus) from all over the galaxy to smash the angry peasants that nuked your home. The story is enjoyable though. I enjoyed it.Style - 5/5Style? You have a kick-♥♥♥ ship, space lasers, space whales? Huh? Anyway, you have your own robot-piloting, waifu army. These bad girls have lasers, rockets, rail guns, swords and sidearms. They also disable capital ships, snipe rocket frigates, and download enemy porn collections? Urgh, that stupid pervert. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great.Since it's 100% free, get this awesome game.\n",
      "Game is really fun to play with friends and bots, lots of customization to do with your cars and you get a new item every game which is good.My only issue with the game is during seasons it crashes sometimes when choosing matches and stuff.9.5/10All in all, a game that you should pick up right now!\n",
      "I would highly recommend this game to anyone. but it does has flaws but hey, it's still in early access. in order to play with friends you port port forward your router. but there will be dedicated servers 3.0. so that will make things much more easier to play with your friends. I will would unturned a 9/10. it's a awsome game. and plus it's free after all. you always try it.\n",

      "Finally got this over steam since my disk (RIP) is no longer usable... I got Morrowind as a birthday present several years ago.  I'd never heard of it, my whole family had never heard of it, I had no clue what I was going into when I first installed it.  My parents didn't see their 11 year old son for days when I started playing.The world this game dropped me into has held a special little place in my imagination, and computer, ever since.  I hadn't played much more than pokemon and a couple online games when I first got this.  After, every new RPG I ever tried to play was compared to Morrowind, and I was always left just a little dissapointed that they didn't match up.No, it's not a game everyone's going to enjoy (the oldschool style of play gets on some peoples' nerves), but it's one everyone should at least try because it's well worth it.  You can do what I did, explore a whole new world that breaks far away from typical fantasy RPGs, delve into what made the Elder Scrolls great and unique with their crazy storylines and obsessive attention to their own lore, or even just goof around like my friend, who stole every book he could find and stacked them up in a random house until there was a chest high wall of books spanning the whole floor.And should you tire of that, the modding community can turn this into any game you like.Oblivion and Skyrim were both great, but they never matched up to the sheer challenge of Morrowind's world, where a foolish mistake was punished quickly, they lacked the alien culture of Morrowind's natives and a variety of skills that were slowly removed as the games were released, even the storylines didn't quite hold up to Morrowind's.Obsessed/10, would play again.  And again, and again.\n",

As of yet while im still learning the game in many ways i have not won a single   1 v 1 match and the community is rather small but they are friendly and easy to get along with apart from one guy who was raging over the fact i was using strategy in a strategy game.

      "tl;dr It's like pirates tower defence naval combat sim with trading?I originally bought this game because someone compared it to Sid Meier's Pirates! but said the naval battles and city capturing were a lot better. That is definitely a true statement. If you want a complex strategy game with diplomacy and something new around every corner, this is not the game for you. The missions are thoroughly repetitive and if you like that style of gameplay, everything so far has felt like a long slow grind getting from one side of the map to the other. However, beating up pirates and trying to figure out how to win a naval battle against three pirates who are bigger and more badass than you is super fun and I have died a solid six or seven times in three hours of gameplay trying to take on an area or battle that was too much for me. I'd recommend playing co-op as it's a lot more fun to raid and plunder and fight for supremacy with a friend on the map - though character players feel OPd (if only because PCs can manoeuvre better), even in areas that i would think are meant to be a lot harder for you. All in all i'd give this game a solid 7/10.Pros:Naval battlesPiratesBlowing stuff upDoesn't require a ridiculous amount of thinkingCo-opCons:RepetitiveI cannot see the appeal in playing a diplomatic or trade based game (though I may change my mind when I need a lot more money)Graphics are eh\n",

Many great features and the only thing I could ask for is Australian servers. Other than that keep updating and adding more to this fun free to play game. Oh and it's sorta pay to win but like paying doesn't impact other players and sorta ruins the experience of the actual game itself.\n",

      "Guns of Icarus Is a good game a mix between Co-op and PvP. The game encourages you to bring friends along to play with you. The game lets you take on roles to keep your airship in battle.  What Makes Guns of Icarus so good in my opinion:- Theres 7 airships to choose from each with their own weaknesses and strengths- Theres a wide variety of guns to choose from from gattling guns to flare guns to mines- Not many people in Guns of Icarus are TOXIC in my opinion that I have seen. making it easier since the community is helpful and friendly. especially if you have voice chat they will be very happy to helpThere isnt a lot of bad things in this game and a lot of it isnt really much of a big deal. this game is not buggy so I really think its a good job.10/10\n",

      "Have you ever thought to yourself, \"Gee I wonder what it would be like if I was Kawii Desu Nee-San anime Princess?\" Well think no more my friend, for this game has the answer. It starts with you (Princess Kawaii) being pulled out of school by you father because your ♥♥♥♥♥ of a mother selfishly died. With her out of the picture, it becomes your duty to become the next princess. You do this by taking 2 different classes every week which in turn increase some of your skill levels. However this isn't like Skyrim where you can be a god at everything, instead you need to be a bit more carfull in what skill you want to increase.For example, if you wish to level up your intelect through history and diplomancy, you may be able to flatter that losser of a Prince after you remember his birthday. However in doing this you probably won't be skilled enough to dodge the arrow that just penetrated your Liver. Oh look, you're dead, try again...After you have completed your classes for the week, you than get see some more of the story unfold. It is also here where your learnt skills come into action, as they determin your success. You also get to make some choices in these events that ultimatly determin the fate of you and your kindom. There are also alot of pre-set events that you can't do anything about, so I wouldn't get to exited. My personal favourite event was when some peasent sent me a fanfiction of me having sex with a Squid.After these events you get the option of choosing an activity to do over the weekend, this affects your mood, which in turn affects how well you learn in your classes. Say if you are in an Angry mood, you will get a bounis in Swordfighting, but you will recive a penalty to Accounting. There are plenty of ways to play this game, however it can't can't give you endless enjoyment like 'Barbie Dollhouse Adventure' as after a few tries at the game, you notice that the story may be fairly linear. But that may have just been because I wasn't very imaginative with what actions I took during the game. I don't really have many dislikes with this game, possibably because I came in not expecting very much. One annoyance was that the only charater that shows any emotion at all is you. Also be prepared with the lore in this game, as there are heaps of Dukes and Duchesses which I couldn't be bothered to remember.I bought this game when it was on sale for $1.50 and I personally think $10 is a bit too much for this game. However if you buy it, it's a fairly fun little indie game.\n",
      "This game is the first FPS I played. I was terrible at shooting games back then and my friend would always beat me. I still had loads of fun though. Although the community isn't as large as it used to be, it has matured and isn't full of 12-year-old boys, hackers, griefers and de-rankers, as featured in CS:GO. It is still a quality game and I recommend it, if for no other reason than to experience the evolution of Counter-Strike.\n",
      "One of the best free-to-play RPG's available. Completely addictive! Play with friends and don't grind alone for maximum results.\n",
      "I noticed a few people in my friends list playing this game, and I also saw it on the front page of the store, seeing that it was free, I decided to check it out. When I first started, I had no idea what I was doing, looted a few places, ate maybe 3 berries and ended up dying of poisoning.After maybe 3 days of just leaving it be, I decided to REALLY try to get into it.Crafting is a bit complitcated, but once you recipes multiple times you start to get used to it, but it's always nice to have the wiki up just in case.Weapons are great, and finding all the ammo you need to for them can take time, but soon, you will become unstoppable.Watch a few guided on Youtube and you'll get the idea pretty quick on what to do.I really do recommend this game, it's great fun, and I've only done the single player, so I can't even imagine what it's like with a friend. Since the game IS in early access, I'm really looking forward on what this guy's gonna do in the next updates. If this game can get some open source stuff going on, it could be up there with DayZ and the other great zombie games.So play it, and while you're at it, buy a Gold account, you can get some cool stuff for your character and the game, and it helps support Nelson.\n",
      "Best Game I have Ever Played! And yes I have played that many hours don't judge me :~:. I just love how this game is designed from it's looks to its sounds, I have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them. Sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an AK-47. And yet I thought this game couldn't get any better but Valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists. It also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game, but beware, most of these people in competitives aren't very nice no matter what you do, however, you may run into a few polite ones along your journey.And even better! When you shoot a chicken they EXPLODE. They also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events!If you ever have a spare $15 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PICK UP THIS GAME! Plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars ;D. Now please hurry the frick up and BUY THIS GAME 20/10!(Edited paragraphs after dashed line)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well now i'm back to this review and oh god can I even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since I have posted this? They now have a workshop in which you can make you're own camo's/skins to be picked by Valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece (Although, it is a bit complicating).This game is probably the most realistic game out there (next to Insurgency). It's nothing like ♥♥♥♥ing COD where all you have is 10 year old trollers. You actually find people who are willing to help out AS A TEAM. Now I know i'm rambling, but stick with me, i'm gonna put pro's and cons in.Pros:-Quite realisticCan make some extra moneyLong lasting gameplayCompetitive gamemode (ranked)DemolitionAn awesome arrange of gunsConstantly gets updated.Cons:-People aren't always the nicest.Griefers.Well I think that is all I can add to this review apart that it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.

      "Today I will write a review on the game called Garry's Mod, I will review the modes single player and multiplayer seperately...Single-player mode: In single player mode, Garry's Mod becomes a sandbox for the people who play it. You go onto a map made from either another game or made by the Garry's Mod team or by yourself. In single player, the player will start off with an avatar, a variety of weapons and tools and their own creative mind (if they have one). You will be given a large list of things to use such as NPC's, weapons, entities and props. By yourself, you can make anything that comes to mind for example a slide, challenge or a rollercoaster, maybe even a scene from a movie. If you feel like giving the gaming world a taste of your creativity, you can submit your creation to the world of gaming. The only annoying things about this is when you only have a limited amount of suppiles due to not having a certain game created by the same people who made this one, Valve. I have to say that if you want a bit of alone time whilst playing a game but you don't want to be under pressure, you might just find that this is just what you need. You can choose to go on a rollercoaster (which is rather boring in my opinion) or you can do something as crazy as having to fight off a large horde of zombies all at one with your only weapons being a machete and a crappy pistol (which doesn't take long for me, but I find it quite enjoyable. So if you're looking for a game/ game mode that's lets you do almost anything you want, this is what you might just need. Multi-Player mode: Multi-player mode provides you with a large variety of game modes, stretching from Role Play to Being a traitor among terroists. These game modes, allow you to play with people from all around whatever country you come from, sometimes even other ones! This could make you a social butterfly, or it could ruin your life. The game mode I find most sociable is Trouble in Terroist Town, more commonly referred to as TTT. There are hundreds of different things to do over the multi-player mode, and you can do it with friends too! Just a heads up is that most of the servers are run by a group of people, so don't intimidate them otherwise you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There are millions of possibilities in multiplayer mode, you can do things like go on adventures in sewers or build a bridge out of bathtubs. The one thing I found irritating about this is the lag spikes, but I guess that's my own fault. So if you want to be with friends while not with friends and have fun with them doing a large number of different thing, this might just be thing you're looking for. Okay so now for the Pros and the cons, I'll do them seperately for each mode...Single-Player mode:Pros:1. A chance to be alone and share creativity.2. Give yourself a challenge.3. Lets you do almost anything you want. 4. You can make the most simple things as random as you like. Cons:1. You might have some trouble if there's something you want to do with a friend, it may not let you. 2. Only lets you use the equipment you have from the games you own.3. If there's soemthing you're really desperate to use, it might not be avaliable or it could take too much time to get set up.4. Somethings you expect to be a challenge end up being easier than expected, giving you nothing to do.Multi-Player mode:Pros:1. Lets you do something specific with friends which can bring more enjoyment to whatever it us you're doing.2. Lets you socialise with other people, make friendships, maybe even relationships.3. If in a bad mood, beating others or ending up being the one on top can make you feel good. 4. Being out numbered in a fight can fill you with adrenaline and make it more exciting for you.Cons:1. Certain things you do could have a bad affect on your life, career or reputation.2. Modes can get rather plain and boring after a long period of playing.3. Restrictions.4. Not every person you meet will be nice, there are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on this game, but they normally float from server to server, which won't cause you much problems.In general, Garry's Mod is an incredible game made of games. It is a whole other genre of gaming, almost mastering Single-Player and Multi-Player mode. It is almost a world made from the minds of people just like you and me.I recommend Garry's Mod for anyone who is looking for a new experience in gaming and can have fun by playing either alone or with friends. This is a game for any age honestly, they just have to know what they're doing.My final rating for Garry's Mod is 8.4.Garry's Mod, you certainly don't disappoint.This is SusOnMe, signing out.

      "In short:  This is a very closed world JRPG style game which features a cast of cutesy girls who  beat up monsters minding their own business to harvest XP  save their world? It’s very reference heavy and joke heavy in a large part thanks to Meme Overlord Nep. You’ll feel like a massive weeaboo and lose respect of friends and/or family but at least you’ll have fun doing it. Pick up the game if it’s on sale, it’s worth it even if to just try the style and the franchise. I will say though I have started mk2 and its combat is the same and fairly repetitive.  So where do I start with the Neptunia? It's an amusing game, that's for sure and to sum it up it's more or less references to other games the game. For starters place names are named after consoles or based off places in other games. Monsters exist that look like the enemies in space invaders or like Kyubey from the Madoka Magica anime. Items have names from the final fantasy games. Throughout dialogue there are vague references (vague for copyright reasons I would assume) to consoles, people involved with games, websites, anime, manga and I doubt anyone would pick up on all of them, it's actually pretty good. I've been told that the later games actually get a more references, memes and typical game tropes thrown into them and that is amazing.  Positives   Interesting and likely to get a giggle now and again.  Cute and quirky “animu grills” doing “cute things” If that’s your style and you’re down for that.  Did I mention the insane amount of references and jokes the game makes relating all sorts of “geeky” things?   I feel like the word Nep could be used like the word Smurf was and that relacing any verb with the word Nep will make it an innuendo. (Just me? Okay.)   English dub is actually very, very good.  Nep-Nep sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare on levelling up sometimes and it’s amusing.  Nep is bit of goof ball  and MEME OVERLORD  making for a funny experience.   Good sense of humour.   Negatives    It is a huge grind from start to finish it feels. After the first half of the game you really get tired of the grinding and need up put it down.  There are ways to speed up the grind to your desired speed however, I won’t mention it here; I’ll leave that up to you to look into.   Cringe factor is a thing. Rarely something gets said and you just go “ohhf yeah, no”  Holy ♥♥♥♥ do I feel like a massive weeaboo playing this game sometimes.  Your friends will deffinantly think you’re a massive weeaboo for owning it.    It’s difficult at times unless you have the DLC. In which case sadistic Plutia will wreck everyone.   Loss of all self-respect   (see top for short/ final conclusion)\n",
      " TL:DR:   overall this is a fun MMO that you can sink your life and time into hence I did almost failing a semester of university. A game of fantasy, magic, an absolutely beautiful world  and guys playing as small girls.  Create your perfect hero or heroine and go off and ♥♥♥♥ as much ♥♥♥♥ up as you can while helping children and the elderly to gather plants. You’ll lose your free time  and any remaining dignity  but it’ll be a fun time. This game is worth a play especially if like me you’re waiting for Black Desert to be fully released.  This… Game…. Almost failed a semester of University because I got addicted to it during the week of study before final exams.  10/10 worth it.  This game is amazing amounts of fun and it’s free. It’s really solid for a free game and I like a lot of others must ended up buying something from the store. I have 4 characters and 3 of them at the level cap, I just got so addicted to playing this game.  Positives:    This game is free. Holy crap. I would encourage anyone to at least try it for that.  Despite constantly high ping the game played just fine for me.  Pretty much everything you can buy with real money can be bought with in game gold too so if you can afford to buy stuff in game you don’t have to spend any IRL money.  I was able to create a guild called Westside Weeaboos and that’s the best thing ever.  want to be a cute elf girl?  I know I sure do. Heh.  Then this is it, create and customise your perfect doppelganger That looks nothing like the real you lol nerd   People are reasonably helpful and nice at least of PvE servers I played on. Sometimes you get some salty people when you party for end game dungeons though.   Negatives:    No servers outside of Europe and North America. I believe there used to be an Oceania server at one point but not anymore. Despite that though the game generally played very well.  A lot of busy work so things like fetch quests and kill this type quests. Which is something most MMO’s suffer from.   I don’t know if I like this or not but skill specialisations exist where you can only specialise in one thing at a time meaning you need to rely on guilds, market or friends to craft items to use in your specialisation.  Some launcher issues with the game.  (TL;DR/ Conclusion at the top)\n",
      "I will start by saying that CS:GO is a good game that can be a lot of fun. The casual modes allow players to play a variety of game modes in a non-competitive way. So, why the negative review? The ranking system has severe problems and the community can be toxic at times. So the problems:    Smurfs  – not a lot of fun to play with. Higher skilled players getting kicks from kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of lower levelled players.   De-rankers and trolls  – can be Smurfs trying to drop pack again through ranks or someone getting kicks from being annoying. Can’t votekick if 2/5 players on your team are doing it.   Hackers  – I don’t come across these as regularly as some do but still very annoying.   Bad community  – if you have a 5 person team you might be okay. Playing solo it feels like a gamble; sometimes you get friendly people in teams and other times abusive people.  Plenty of 12 year olds have had sex with family so they claim. Also, never heard the words ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and etc. used more than in this game. So why do I have so much play time? The game itself is good to play and when you win it really is satisfying. The issue is mostly some people who ruin it for others. However, it can be fun and casual is always an option if competitive becomes too much. \n",
      " TL;DR:   Fun little builder where playing with friends/ online can be summed up with “You hit my ♥♥♥♥ing space station you massive ♥♥♥♥” and gathering resources is often more of a battle than you’d expect. Often fun to build stupid structures or just mess around with other people you play with. Picked it up for just over 20 Australian rupees on sale and was totally worth it. This is a great build and gather type game, think of it like 3D Terraria in space. You can play in a sandbox where you can build structures to your hearts content or in a survival type mode where you must gather resources in order to build things. The game is pretty fun with other people and the community support means you can get blue prints and mods that can be added without messing around with a third party mod manager. There have been a few bugs along the way but the developers are pretty good with fixing those as they know about them (The game is early access, after all). The base maps are pretty solid too. I’ve played mostly on the earth one and so far I have managed to get to mars, the moon and an alien planet as I believe these were all there was when I was playing. In short, if you can spare USD 25 (Or, if like me you’re Australian the USD-AUD is pretty crappy right now so that’s 35 dollarydoos) then this is a great little game solo and even more fun with others.\n",
      "Good Game,Only problem is the community.Because they kick you out, no matter what happens.At any reputation level, KICKReputation Level 100 Infamy 25, KICKDoes something correctly, KICKHave a Weapon skin that does absolutely nothing to affect stats, KICKHave a Weapon skin with stat boost, KICK (this one is obvious since about 90% of the community hates it so much)Asks a question, KICKSets up drill before the host does, KICKGets to escape van before host, KICKSeriously, either play with friends, or put your rooms to private or just leave the community.To be fair though, i still like Payday 2 despite OVERKILL breaking promises (probably because im an idiot). but i dont play payday 2 much since the comminity sucks now\n",
      "This would have to be one of the best Early Access titles that I purchased. Being a big fan of the original installment, when I heard about the second installment, I was excited. Did this game manage to live up to the excitement? Yes, Definitely! The only \"flaw\" currently that I have found is the lack of content, BUT! This game is in Early Access and more content will obviously be added. From the (as of 24/04/2015) 4 hours that I spent playing this game, both solo and with friends, I feel like this game has incredible promise.The good:*Visuals - This game's visuals are stunning. The graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game's predecessor, without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed.*Performance - This game has very good optimization. I was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end PC and still manage a stable 60fps, with only a few ocassional drops.*Gore - The gore system got a massive overhaul, which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of Zeds and watch it literally explode, spraying everything in blood. Each Zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment, so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb.*UI - The user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game, making everything more sleek and easy to access. The Vendor Pod has a very nice interface as well, with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across.*Classes - Although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time, the skills/class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in. *SDK - The game has been noted to have the SDK and community creations implemented later on in development, which is great, as I found the community creations one of the best parts of the first game.*Humour - That's right, the wonderful British banter from the first game makes a comeback, better than ever. I mean who doesn't love British people insulting zombies. :P*Dosh - Aww yis, the dosh now has physics! You can literally make piles of money. Grab it while it's hot lads!The bad:*Enemy Grapple - This could be considered as nitpicking, but the new way that the Zeds grab you is quite honestly a pain in the ♥♥♥. When encountered with large crowds, it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away, only to be grappled by another one and spun around. I personally preferred the grappling from the first game, where they just slow down your movement, until you can't move.*Servers - I'm giving the game credit with this one, but I'm just going to list it here for the time being, since I consider it a negative part. (At this point in time). Currently the servers that are available are almost all full, with only a few with much higher latency being available. All of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, but as of this point in time, the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious. >Also, I'm not sure if this is a glitch, but 90% of the time, when a game is finished I am often sent back to the main menu screen, even on my friend's game<All in all, if you're a fan of the original installment, I'd highly recommend picking this up. If you're a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in Early Access, I'd probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale, as there currently isn't too much content. If you've never played the first game in the franchise, but you're interested in Zombie Survival games, such as Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving this game a try. I can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops.\n",
      "It's only in Alpha and it's already better than most games on steam!The game is a mix of dayz and minecraft, but leaning more towards Dayz. It's been said by the developers that they don't want to be another Dayz clone though, so by it's finished stage it'll end up being something new and different.This game really strives off of human interaction, either you can trust everyone or trust no one. In the end your still going to die though....The best thing you can do if you plan to buy this game is look for a freind who'll play it with you. The game is fun by itself, but with a friend it makes the game a better experience. Not saying you can't go lone wolf and find groups to build with and/or raid others.The feel/atmosphere of the game feels like a cavemen era game, though once you get into the game you'll realise these cavemen can craft a lot of nifty things. Be warned, if you see a guy in a red jacket, blue pants and a bennie..... Get the hell out of there!Once alpha is finished and this goes into beta or full release we'll end up with an exceptionally great game!Also a Pro tip: Press F1 in-game and type censor.nudity false to see all the glory hiding behind everyones pants :)\n",
      "Lovely game, can build and break friendships, if you like arguing over who was supposed to get what pager and whose fault it is that you failed stealth then this is your game. Game is almost pointless without DLC, so even though it costs a lot, I recommend having all of the DLC, or at least majority of it for the full experience.The game has become a lot easier the longer it has been out for, so it's pretty noob friendsly by now. And the amount of free weekends and sales on there's no reason not to have it in your library.\n",
      "Very fun to play with friends\n",

Fyi: Only I can be a ♥♥♥♥ to other people. No one else can.PROS:- Simple to wrap your head around- Range of weapons to kill people with (If you must, you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.)- 5 types of enemies (Fast zombies, Slow zombies, Zombies that are just zombily, Mega zombies and players [♥♥♥♥ you if you're a player].)- Rewarding XP system- Mod support- 3 maps by default- optional singleplayer- Trolling people is rewardingCons:- ♥♥♥♥ing Players- Reveals Humanity deserves to die- Singleplayer is no fun without players however- Map size / player ratio (on most servers. 12 players per server [imo] is best. 24 players [imo] is too high) makes map to smalls- Inventory system is terrible- Hitboxes that are oddTL;DR - Why do I play this? Because I'm crazy and so are you!Rage mode review:Unturned is a game that will make you rage. Death is your constant companion because of the rules that KOS applyby default on servers, according to players that play online atleast. Why? because it's an infinitely repeating cycle. Once one player killed someone without questioning why, that guy started doing the same. Those achievements for killing other players are also motivating factors. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, why can't we be friends, mayte?TL;DR - ♥♥♥♥ you if you're a player who kills on sight\n",
      "Mini Motor racing is really fun and childish but it gets really boring fast. I think this would be a lot of fun to derp around with friends or random people on the internet, to bad nop one is playing it.I have also tried the Ios version and it seems better on Ios, so if you are going to buy this game, buy it on Ios.6/10 Fun but it gets boring fast\n",
      "Upon loading up and getting started with BanHammer it becomes quite clear that I am a little out of my depths as a solo player in a game intended to be played with a friend as a local co-op game. That isn’t to suggest that the game isn’t soloable, it certainly is once you learn how to play the game. However, you may not find the game as entertaining as if you did play in a group. With this line of thought I'll site the Borderlands games as comparable (better with friends than solo). If you do have friends to join you then you’re really going to be in for a treat. The ability to kill mob after mob after mob while rescuing animals being attacked by game hunters is a lot of fun. The graphics are perfect for what the game needs, the sound is fine and the game play is smooth. You will find some people complaining about bugs and other annoyances in the game but in my time with the game I did not notice anything out of the ordinary which correlates to the more recent or updated reviews who claim that a patch repaired the game.There are a wide variety of weapons and other tools/power ups that players can utilize and although you are thrown in from the deep end, a lack of tutorial hurts the game, once you begin to understand what you are doing in regards to the quests the game opens up. It’s an easy game to recommend to those of you who enjoy action games especially for the price. However do note that the game was bundled in its greenlight phase and that’s generally a sign that the game will ultimately find itself in another bundle sooner than later. Still, this one is worth the small price especially if you can get into that local co-op.For more reviews similar to this and regular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\n",

It is lovely to see a game pursue the idea of every play through meaning something, but not have it possibly ruin your gameplay in the future.\n",
      "This game is a very unique game with both first person and third person gameplay. It does feel like world of tanks but the only minecraft consepts in it is the first person creating and the blocks ( but almost all games have blocks in them) so its not at all like minecraft.You Make 1 of 3 types of robots; a Car or tank, hover and flyer or a combernation. Personaly i find it easier to make and use a car but everybody is better at others. The creating is at first person view which makes it quite easy to create your robots. You can buy more items to create your robot in the store. Once you are done you have 2 options; Battle or Practice. Practice is a mode where you can freely use your robot around a well disigned map. Their are all three combinations of robots you can battle to test your robots power with its guns. After you have finished testing your robot you can go to battle and have team battles online to gain money and level up.Over all a very good game and worth trying out on your own or with a friend.\n",

      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA77HSGk0FAZombie games have really come into their own during the last decade; I for one enjoy picking up a zombie survival game now and then just to cause havoc throughout the world. The idea of an open world survival zombie game isn't new and to be honest the last few games such as H1Z1 and Day Z have been somewhat of a letdown due to unfinished content or their empty promises. Dying Light feels like a push in the right direction for all those who try to master the survival zombie genre.Now I can honestly say this game plays more like a Far Cry or a Dead Island game more so than a true survival game we've been forced fed over the past few years, but I am really quite happy about that. When an open world survival game such as H1Z1 is released I feel discouraged when playing for a few hours only to realize that I am playing a very unfinished game with little to no polish what so ever. Opening up an AAA title such as Dying Light makes the experience so much more enjoyable when things just work.The campaign showcases the game which is great to see. Instead of hand holding quests and boring gathering missions the game tries to introduce different elements to the user with every quest. The player can experience most of the game’s content without having to do the campaign, but if the player wants an explanation or reasoning behind elements of the game they can find out through side quests and story missions. For example, experiencing night for the first time was a daunting experience due to not knowing what the hell going on, but completing some story missions I find out that “volatiles” appear during the night and are pretty much zombies on steroids and 52 red bulls.The story plays out well, set in the fictional city Harran. You come across survivors that feel like survivors not just random people who found a gun on the side of the road. The story throws you in the midst of a war between a rebel-ish faction and a pure survivalist clan. I was surprised to see the scare factor really got to me during some story missions. One mission when exploring an abandoned school had me expecting jump scares around every corner. Weaving and ducking around corners only to die from a rebel wielding an axe.Character development and interaction is another highlight, I usually find myself disagreeing with the protagonist in these types of games, but the background of the main character is pretty strong even in the diplomatic situation he finds himself in. The typical character types are throughout the game as well, the boss man with the ridiculously big chest tattoo, the kid who needs to prove himself, tough female combat commando and the old man who just wants everyone to be friends.The free running aspect of the game is pretty enjoyable, if mirrors edge was your thing, but you found it a little too easy, Dying Light would be right up your ally. Not knowing if that jump is a little too far or if the roof was going to collapse is a fun experience when throwing hordes of zombies into the mix. There really is no limitation on what can be scaled or leaped from, which is what I really do enjoy about open world titles such as Dying Light.The night and day cycle is pretty great. The game gives you an opportunity to sleep through the night at a safe house or roam the streets at night, risking those pesky volatiles and hordes of stealthy zombies. Planting a flashlight in your hand, the game wants you to venture out during the night, I am still unsure if free running on the tops of buildings or sneaking through the cover of darkness is the way to go when dealing with night time. It is a dynamic change up in the way the game plays and functions from day to night and would most definitely recommend going out at night and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants when a volatile gets a hold of you.I usually have an issue with AI in games like this, but Dying Light really showed me how smart zombies can actually be. The way that the zombies move can range in speed, but they always seem to flank me when I least expected it. Different zombies have the ability to climb up walls to meet you for some fisty cuffs on rooftops and other can spit vile fluids at you from below.Like Totalbiscuit, I too can be prone to sickness from staring at a game with a smaller field of vision. It is true that Dying Light has a FOV slider which can dramatically help with headaches and eye strain, but unfortunately in this case it also came with some bugs when doing so. Changing the FOV to full caused NPCs to oddly pause as they go off-screen in cinematic and perform weird combat animations that interrupted combos. These bugs aren’t game breaking, but it took me out of this amazing world of zombies and made me think about climbing an invisible pole due to the FOV slider.Three talent trees add some unique gameplay, which felt like it would be needed if the game became stale after 60 hours or so. Splitting the trees up into survivor, agility and combat was a smart idea to allow the player to focus on one aspect if it seems to be lacking. Skill points are generated by experience which can be farmed if need be.Now the combat is where the game in my opinion becomes difficult. As an experiment, I tried to lure as many zombies as I could see if we had another Batman: Arkham style combat system, whereby only one enemy could attack at once and if it could be possible to defeat whole armies. Nope, I got squashed. Combat is hard and I haven’t seen anything quite like it in a while. I was lucky enough to find a gun in the first few hours of gameplay, but with the very (very) limited ammo around I only had about 14 shots. Using melee weapons I found myself running away from most hordes of zombies and that is what I really wanted from this game.The crafting system is pretty stock standard; you can buy or find different blueprints which permanently allow you to craft a weapon. With the amount of resources around the world, it was quite easy to craft very simple weapons without feeling the need to bash zombies over the head with only fists. An issue I found with the weapon system was how expandable the weapons are. Buying weapons from the vendor seemed quite pointless due to the repairing mechanic whereby once a weapon cannot be repaired anymore it is rendered useless.Dying Light was pretty much the game I wanted; I got a little too scared at times, but it added to the frustration upon death and the sense of self worth when completing a difficult task. Not being a fan of the under developed zombie games floating around, Dying Light was an extremely fun time and I don’t think I will stop playing anytime soon. If you're into Parkour and zombies I suggest picking up this game and killing some infected with friends or just by yourself.\n",
      "Trackmania's uniquely in-depth track creator and rule-of-cool physics could have added up to a great game, but the community has utterly killed it.I was sold by the demo servers. The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.And then it all comes tumbling down.Half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.If this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self.\n",
      "Source Filmmaker is a tool that requires hours of investment and a willingness to learn before you can make anything remotely watchable in it. Even though it's still miles more user friendly than most professional 3D animation software, those looking for a tool with the pick-up-and-useability of Garry's Mod will be sorely disappointed.Also, if your computer uses a 720p monitor, don't even bother. It's not worth the hassle.\n",
      "So, this is easily my most-played, go-to multiplayer game whenever I've had friends over for the past year or so... basically since I started playing it. Whether I'm working with or against my buddies, you're guaranteed some good times with this one.\n",
      "this game is awesome beyond compare from the items and content to the bosses.my friends and i used to play the game all the time at school.we had illegal copies but we all bought the game on steam afterwards so unexpected advertising.ive acctualy played 100 hours plus of this as ive played it since when it first came out.it has been amazing to say the least and ive worked very hard to stay ahead of my freinds in boss and item progressthe game content has reportedly been finished with the moonlord update but the game is still being updated with better mod support and a creative mode among other things10/10  Would underestimate cthulu againEDIT: EXPERT MODE IS BS\n",
      "vezzy vezzy good, nice physics, needs alot of friends 9.5/10\n",
      "Best turn based strategy game I've ever played, has great game customization with different map types and other preferences and options. Definitely recomend for a game alone or with friends.\n",
      "This is by far one of my all time favourite games due to the sheer replayability of this game. Every playthrough is always different in some way, they may go smooth as silk or they can turn to hell in a split second. This game is especially fun when played with friends as you can get up to all kinds of crazy antics, whether it be 'accidental' friendly fire incidents or just simple acts of stupidity. This is a great game, play it!\n",
      "This is probably one of the best Free-To-Play games out there (that I know of anyway). It is a third-person shooter that combines the addictiveness of levelling  and upgrading your gear in MMOs with pretty open parkour capabilities and a set of exoskeleton suits which all vary in playstyle and appearance. As you would expect in an free-to-play game, you can buy a lot of the stuff, if you want, but to be honest, everything that the game has to offer can be obtained by actually playing the game and items earned that way always feel the best. Such as slowing acquiring the components for a Warframe by constructing them and then combining them and in just 3 days you have yourself a shiny new Warframe, always exciting if I do say so myself. It can also be great fun if you play with friends as anyone can join anyone's game so an experienced player can carry a new player to the ends of the galaxy (literally in this game) and it is always fun flipping all over the places and doing slide kills (even though it may be a little impractical).\n",
      "9.8/10 to much recoil IGNjk its a good game and i do recommend it even though im bad at it its dun to play with friends\n",
      "A nice racing game.Sadly MP is somewhat dead. I recomend to play it with friends.\n",
      "Well, let me tell ya, this is an awesome game, even if i dont have the 4k graphic settings, its still looking good!!!And The Online, if you have friends, it will be the most funny experience ever.So in other words, this game its worth its full price and your (free) time.\n",
      " The game that gave me endless fun years ago. I've played this since 2011 (Gmod 12) but I don't play it as much anymore but I have to say, for someone my age back then, this game was such a blast and I couldn't stop playing it. I remember booting up singleplayer and then downloading stuff off the Toybox seeing what people have created and uploaded including myself uploading a save of a VW Golf and a Nissan 350z and reading comments; Anyway, then I'd download mods off https://garrysmods.org/ and I'd have to figure out how to install them as a 11-12 year old who was new to installing things haha. I'd even mention this game to friends at school and show my friends if they were over. Also I made an abundance of friends playing this game online. Many laughs and tears. :') I've met lots of great people through it. Looking back at my screenshots off my old computer is always giving me nostalgia of the fun I had.This game gave me lots of joy and I can't thank it enough. And it still does when I load it back up and give it a go nowadays. This game has improved in many ways. I really do recommend this game. It is great fun and you can do whatever you like with it! :) Thanks for reading!  Here is the first video I ever made of the game back in 2011 (currently unlisted and due to old YouTube channel) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yAJG1HhU2g \n",
      "It's neat, I guess. If you need motivation, imagine you are an avid gamer, and some guy is trying to take away your games. Enough motivation already, ya? How about he also tried taking away your prized teddy bear. Terraria, after 15 hours with a friend, will become that teddy bear.Good? Good.\n",
      "This is a change from my original review. This game is EHHH but not WOO HOO AMAZING! This game is Terraria with space ships and a interesting graphics. This game was fun for me when I first picked it up, but quickly lost its charm. I got diamond pickaxe and a giant fortress in the 8 hours I have played. That may be slower then, say MC or something, but it still.GRAPHICSIt's a really interesting graphical build. I've never seen a game look the way this does. I really kinda like it, but just because a game looks good, doesn't mean it's a good game. I like the graphics, SUE ME!GAMEPLAYEHHHH... EHH... MEHH.... Not TERRIBLY good. I quickly blasted right through it. I got Diamond 3 hours in. That's faster then I can find Diamond in MC. And I know EXACTLY where to find 'em. The gameplay is mostly a Hack & Slash type game with a crafting system and building. The building is odd with that you always use four blocks instead of just one. The grid system in play here is so large, this four block per place is completely needed to play the game. Unlike Terraria, where the grid is only one block per block system. Which I prefer, in my opinion. If you KINDA SORTA A LITTLE BIT like the idea, wait until it's in a major sale. MULTIPLAYERIt's there. There are very cool servers on here. Pretty cool, but it still doesn't excuse the crap singleplayer experience. If you are gunna get this game, do two things. One, buy it on a sale. Two, get a friend to play it with. Oh, and Skype. Or Teamspeak. Or use the crap Steam voice chat. I don't know how to make a server, Google that. All in all, I give this a 3 out of 10. In normal terms, that's a major MEEEEHHH. You really have to be in the mood to play this game, or just love this type of game.\n",
      "This game is so much fun. If you want to call it a board game its the best board game Ive played on a computer. Do not let it looks fool you. For several years ive been looking at this game but because it didnt look \"exciting\" or \"too complicated\" I resisted it. I finally gave it a shot and wish I got it sooner! Still yet to play with people but single player is still really fun. The game may look confusing but its quite simple and not too hard to pick up. A very very good strategy game indeed. You start as a early civilization and have several ways to win but in short become the best and most prosperous civilization in a certain area military, technolgically, religously etc. Its all a race to see who is better. But Beware! this game is such a time waster what may seem minutes into the game can be hours in real life! Last point to make is that the DLC is worth it! Itll extend the fun in this game for twice maybe 3 times as long! New ways to play and new civilizations to try out as long as your friend has the same DLC as well but you can always toggle them on/off when needed. If you love strategy board games that is a real time waster and even have other people that are willing to try this game GET IT! Dont let the looks of this game decieve you!\n",
      "I got this game for free because my friend told me this was free for 1 day i thought this game was going to be a failure and was one of the reasons why it was free but once i downloaded it and played god is it fun! its a normal stealth game with a grusome amazing sniper rifle, 50-75% of the time it shows the bullet leave the barrel and entering the target through the head skull heart etc. and blood and gore is just everywhere... The plot takes place in WW2 where you take jobs on killing russians and  germans sabotaging their plans. It is worth the buy!\n",
      "To be fairly honest: The first time I stepped in the game, my friend gave me all the end game armor and basically I was OP..So, I created a new character, so I could experience what this game had to offer. And, no surprise. I loved it!- Music is amazing.- Gameplay feels smooth and controls are responsive. - The story, although not too obvious, is pretty compelling. Overall, this game is amazing. Buy it.Oh and the new update is cool too, so yeah-\n",
      "Oh my god, this game is awesome. It's tons of fun, especially with friends, 10/10. You. Buy. Game. Now.\n",
      "i cant even get into a match. i dont know if its my internet or what. my friends tried joining a server and they had the same problem i had. we sat here for half an hour waiting for it to load\n",
      "This is by far, what Arma 3 should have been. The community, the game, the engine is all how a military simulator should be. I have not joined a single game WITHOUT friends, that wasn't a well co ordinated game and all round fun for our squad and the rest of our team. The gameplay is captivating and the environments are incredibly immersive. The sounds are 10/10 from gravel crackling under your shoes to the sound of bullets flying past, narrowly missing your skull. Great game so far, has so much potential and the developers work extremly close with the community. Cant wait for vehicles to be implemented next month. :D\n",
      "Its a fun game even with the bugs you can just injoy the game with friends.\n",
      "The game play is very fun to play with friends is always a pleasure for the game is a good game, but I like to make my blog ore subsidiary.\n",
      "Interesting game. Good to play with friends. If you don't have any that's okay. I understand your feelings and I pity you for that was me once. Then I went outside. But this game made me come back inside so I can play it with all the friends I made outside.\n",
      "great game for teamwork for when you are playing with friends in competition matches, great fast pace gameplay\n",
      "Sanctum 2 is one really the only FPS/Tower Defence Game.  No game has dones something like this before and had the risk of majorly failing.  Coffee Stains studios did extremely well in their game.  They've put so much detail into every map and enemy.  Coming from their first Sanctum, they really kept it up.  Even though there are big changes, it will still feel like the first one.  Both games rely heavily on your strategies.  There are multiple ways to beat the level but there are always those setups that beat every other.  I have to say, Co-op is where this really gets the fame and attention it has.  Playing a normal Tower Defence, you are by yourself, just watching things happen.  Sanctum solo makes you feel pretty awesome as you are taking down waves after waves.  But when the co-op starts, things get much better.  You and your friends will be jumping all over the map blasting enemies to pieces and having a great time.  I have played a lot more solo than I have co-op but I definetely like Co-op more.  You get more people to with resources to build your towers, two extra guns and 3 perks to switch with.  The choice of perks and weapons and towers are very important.  You don't want to take an Anti-Air tower into a map with no flying units (that's a wasted tower), and you don't want a perk that gives you speed increase if it's a map where you don't even need to run and you can stay still the whole time.  There are perks and weapons for almost every kind of play style, from cover sniper, to rocket launcher madman and your classic assault.  Downsides: Difficulty is random as the story continues.  And I don't mean if you do well on one level it suddenly gets hard.  I mean that you can be going through easy levels, then the next 2 are extremely hard and it gives no warning, suddenly gets hard then drops back down.  It will cause frustration but there is a restart button if you get stuck.  Lag:  I know this isn't the game's fault but if you are playing with someone and one of you has lag or gets a random lag spike, it really downs the game and makes it impossible to play properly.  If lag is an issue for you, stay away from Co-opTroll weapons:  I'm serious, there are some weapons in the game that look like they have been made for trolling other players.  They have serious knockback and will p*ss people off a lot.  It sends the person being shot flying and knocking them off the map in the middle of a big fight.  This is one of my favourite games because it's just works brilliantly in so many ways.  There are more things I should talk about such as how great the game looks and the little minigames featured, but I won't.  That's for you to experience.\n",
      "My girlfriend won't let me play in peace. She's a monster.\n",
      "AWESOME Game, love it. I play and play and play......................even that i work in transport i still love playing ETS2Cant wait to see what SCS come up with next, maybe a multiplayer version? I can picture it, 3 friends traveling together in game and doing deliveries together how awesome!! Dave\n",
      "I first started playing this game a while ago and I must say it's come a long way. Seeing all my OP friends makes me want to grind like they did to achieve maximum bada**ery. However it is a grindy game and as a driving game guy not really my type either. That being said I still recommend this game to people considering it, it's free so give it a shot[EDIT]I've played 441 minutes in this session alone.. make it stop..\n",
      "If you haven't played Payday 2 yet then this is a great place to start. I had a lot of fun with friends when I picked it up on the free weekend that Overkill was doing. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though as there is a lack of content and only so much replayability. If you can get this and/or Payday 2 on a good sale then I highly recommend it\n",
      "I picked this up for 99 cents and got my friends some copies too. It was fun while it lasted, be careful who you invite to your sessions because they can make it living hell..\n",
      "steam servers crashed, got a competitive ban :D i would definitley recommend this to my friends and other people across steam to get this game to you can get banend for your connection timing out :P 11/10  would get banned again.\n",
      "So, I am reviewing mods this whole week. Ive reviewed Estranged and No More Room In Hell yet and Half Life:Before. Now onto Synergy. You can play Synergy if  you have a game using the Source engine. So thats HL, CS etc. It is a Co-op FPS in well-designed levels. The shooting is great. However the main problem is replayability. After a round of having fun, I got bored with the same mechanics.If you want to have fun in this game, play it with friends using voice chat. Otherwise its a5/10Average\n",
      "O.K ive nearly played 800hrs of this sh*t game, dont get it...but when you win its its great :D if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download DOTA 2, that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of seconds.P.S- The game does have a tutorial to get you going but If your new to the MOBA scene take the time to learn, watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy (it can be overwhelming to the new player), i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players.\n",
      "Great game to jam with a few friends, nice graphics, good gameplay, love the stealth aspects aswell and run gun\n",
      "Terraria is a very fun game, here are a few reasons why:.Terraria has a constant good frame rate.Terraria has LOTS AND  LOTS of stuff to do all the time with updates adding huge amounts of new stuff to do..Terraria can be played online as well so you can play with your friends all the time.Overall Terraria is a great game, im sure i missed heaps of it out but my rating for this game is a 8/10PS- this game is paid so i reccomend getting it on special.\n",

      "game can be fun. casual match can go for a matter of minutes so u shouldnt have trouble finding a chance to enjoy a quick round.negatives? - people tend to abuse the voting option and kick people from servers alot. can also be a bunch of negative things said to players in chat and on mic by other players.positives? -  can be fun and addictive trying to beat the other team, the more people playing in the server the more fun it is, especially when the servers filled with friendly respectful players.\n",
      "Playing campaign:>Spawned with flying fortress and a scout ship and was at war with deepwater guard, some bunch of pirate punks>bribed the deepwater guard with my oil, we all friendly with each other>Scrapped the scout ship>camped for 2-3hours and built 4 ships, also improved my fortress>made a laser turret, a prefabricated laser and cannon also added 250+ wooden beams to make spaced walls on the fortress added an AI system to it>Called the deepwater guard c***ts and declared war on them>Sent my fleet of 4 to scout, they didn't send border patrol>Sent fleet back to help defend fortress>Call them c***s again>They sent about 2 capital ships 7 escorts, 2 airborne>oh f*** I'm screwed>Turned on the AI for fleet for combat and turned on the fortress weaponry AI>All hell break loose>Rockets started flying, cannons started their barrages, capital ship with huge a** cannon started firing>A few moments in, weapon AI on fortress got destroyed, had to manually aim the weapons>Manual Laser aim destroyed half their ships (including one of mine, accidents happen :(. ) and disabled one of the capital ships, downed one of the planes, my ships were disabled at this point>Balloon ship thought it was smart by bombing me from above, pointed cannon up and sprayed cannon shells at it>Destroyed the flying s***c***>Other capital ship started circling my fortress, gun depression on the laser couldn't get it>Commando-mode-on>Jump on board the ship and started breaking everything with my smg and power mace>Destroying things left and right, punching the cannon firing piece, destroying their controls etc.>Trying to find ammo barrels to explode the ship>Somehow my mace was doing a lot of damage and destroying wooden beams and steel beams with one hit>Got melted by my own laser because AI got repaired by the damned repairbots12/10 would get blasted by my own laser againDon't question whether you should buy this or not, buy it now.

      "at first this game was fun and awesome ton of stuff to do now before all the fanboys eat me alive i want sya somthing i had the non steam version for a while i lost so i got the steam one so i had about 500+ hours on my non steam version so i know what am talking about but there are some good things+ modsalmost all the bad things can be fixed but i am the 3% of the gamers that play the game 100% mod free atleast until i have done the games  storyline, after i had done the game i put some mods on the game and i loved it and so many of them were lore friendly +graphics the game look very good better than oblivion plus mod can make it look better - walking walking walkingi hate games e.g like pokamon cos you walk every were!!!!!!!! without being attacked by somthing and the horses a too slow - lame combat it feels so lifeless yes the animations are cool but it so annoying and the enemys god it is like they are made of steel and it gets more annoying at the end when you know your weapons should be more than enough to kill your enemys - lags and loading i don't have a $3,000 high end PC but it can play most games but god it lags alot and even if it just me i know that that the loading screens are TOO LONG!!!!!-being evil i am going to say this one time if you kill half of white run and all you have to do is pay a fee of stay in jail for a second and after that no one seem to mind that you just killed every thing in site 5/10 sorry for the bad english i am part aussie and mostly mexican\n",

      "What can I say about this game, except HOLY CRAP IT'S AN AMAZING SIDE-SCROLLER THAT'S HILARIOUS, INTERESTING AND REALLY REALLY FUN!!!!! Outside of my extreme fandom of this amazing game I gotta say that it is really freaking funny because of the narration of the very talented Will Stamper, has different difficulties just incase you think it's too easy and is just an all round amazing game - also Behemoth is noted for their co-op game design so grab a friend and buckle up for YOUR JOURNEY AS TOLD IN YOUR FATEBOOKS OF .... FATE!!!\n",
      "Another unique heist game from the fantastic people at Overkill (along with Last Bullet, Lion Games etc.), just like Payday: The Heist, you take control of one of many characters in search for your very own Payday. Unlike the original game, you can now perform heists in stealth, ensuring that you get in and out with a payday without anyone raising the alarm, giving you extra EXP bonuses and money. As with the original game you have EXP, weapon, armour etc. upgrades, as well as a variety of masks to really place your individual mark into your heists. The original game had ~10 heists to perform on, Payday 2; however, has over a whopping 30+ heists, and they're always creating more, with pre-planning, a variety of add-ons and ways to 'heist' you'll always ensure a successful payday. But make sure you're ready, because if you're not too careful, the police will be on you, and the Death Wish police give you a major run for your money.So armour up, grab your upgraded guns, don your mask and with your friends, you'll finally find your PAYDAY!!\n",
      "Review In Short:Airmech is an Action RTS game taht takes a twist on the genere of RTS gaming. This game is a mix of DOTA/LoL with a game like Starcraft. You control a character/hero that is your Airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often. You can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units. Gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro. This game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive player.Only problems are if you're an Aussie, finding people to play with can be quite difficult. Lag is also an issue if you are an Oceanic player.Feel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer (shameless self-promotion :P ). My name is VIRUSALPHA and I'm one of the few Australian players.Pros:+ LOTS OF CUSTOMISATION ( A CRAPTON OF CUSTOMISATION POSSIBLE)+ Fair Business Model+ Not pay to win+ Casual player friendly+ Intense gameplay+ Frequent updates, balance changes and bug fixesCons:- Not many Oceanic players- Meta shifts frequently post updates (which may or maynot be a good thing)- Meta meta meta. A lot of high tier players use the same tactic, strategy and loadout. People like to use the best units, best setup and best strategy. However if you're skilled enough you can work around it. Can be stale.Slightly Longer Review:(Adding on to the above)The meta shifts A LOT when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes. This is probably a good thing, however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta. There is a tremendous selection of pilots, airmechs, parts and units. The problem is balance. Achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near. Thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 8-10. Why? because those units are best. There's tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best. There's 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3. This is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game. There are units/mechs/items that completely outclass others which is sad. Balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because it's still in BETA.The game's busienss model is fair, or even great. Everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing. A casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day. You can unlock all units, pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing. This currency is called Kudos. The premium currency in this game is Diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with. With thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you CANNOT BUY POWER. You can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver VIP or higher. It's an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being $5USD.Generally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy. You can buy Ultimate Variants of units which are UNBALANCED AND SUPER OVERPOWERED \"BUT\" these can only be used in solo play, player vs AI (co-op) and custom games. These units cannot be used in regualr (unranked or ranked) PvP. Generally these items are for noobs :P Hence, upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory. New players these days are VERY LUCKY. You get free items and cosmetics as you play the game. This is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds. It's an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do I suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money. So try out this game if you havent already. If you don't like it, simply uninstall.This game has a drop system. In this drop systems you can receive crates, cosmtics, pets, consumale items, stuff and rare unit alternatives which cannot be purchased normally. This drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wish.The market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isn't hard at all even for a casual player. At this level you can purchase stuff on the market. At level 50 you can sell stuff on the market. All items on the market are sold for premium currency. Unfortunately reaching level 50 is gonna take A LONG TIME. However after a purchase and obtaining silver VIP the marketis instanly acessable and for use. If you are not a VIP after selling an item you only get 30% of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked. So for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds, you only get 30. There is also an in-game tax of 15%. So if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds, your item will be listed for 115 diamonds. Once sold you get you 100 diamonds.There's loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game. You can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout. There are infantry, light vechicles, trucks, tanks, big tanks, even bigger tanks, artillery, healing, radar units, traps, turrets and socket units that provide speical effects. You have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing, radar and for extra damage out put. In your loadout you can customise your airmech. You can change airmechs, customise its parts, change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff. You have a slot for an item which provide small buffs. Finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play style.The game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your level.In terms of gameplay you will always be using your airmech to carry your units across the map. You can pick your units up and micro them. There are mass commands for macroing. Tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radar/artillery jamming. There are many ways to play this game. This game features outposts. Once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep. Yes you have upkeep. You use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands. Outposts and fortresses provide healing. Outposts are occupied by 4 infantry/creeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4. You can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps. You can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there. Generally if you have more outposts than the other guy you're well ahead in winning the game. There some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts. You can socket your \"socket\" units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets. To are 2 ways of winning a game. The first is by having your opponent leave :P The other way is by reducing your opponent/s fortress health to 0. There 2 ways to go about it. You can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an army/convoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition. While the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning. This game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplay.This game often referrences other games and has special events often. For example you can find the Portal Cube, Sentry Turret, and Minecraft Creeper in game. Also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards. That's why you can find Total Biscuit, The Cynical Brit, HuskyStarcraft and Chimmney Swift in the game. Oh yeah about these events, special seasonal items are sold. Such as in Easter you can buy a Jesus pilot and during Christmas you can buy Santa.If RTS is not your thing the game is often called FarmMech as you have a basecamp.... You can grow and builds stuff... It's like Farmville... heh. Bunny Farm OP\n",
      "In short: 6.5/10Pro:- If you love survival-runs this is a nice f2pCons:- Latency issues, I have no idea where servers are located but everyone has 150+ping.- Screaming kids everywhere. If you're semi-competant, you will usually ensure the survial of your team.- Little replay value.-Beware of automatic doors, they kill.- Not much variety in terms of weapons.- Never really got any heart-racing moments.Neutral: -Requires teamwork: best played with friends.- Can get the same experience and probably better if you just join a zombie map on any CS game.You might be wondering, will all these cons why I recommend the game. I had a fun time playing this for 5 hours but there are definitely better games out there. You can run this game very smoothly even with a potato.For a f2p game I honestly cannot complain too much. Codename CURE is a survival-run zombie game. You start off at a drop point and you proceed your way down to a bombsite. There's only one. You work as a team to get there and plant a bomb. You have three minutes to escape before it detonates killing everything on the map. If you die along the way, you have to wait a minute to respawn with temates that are already alive. If everyone dies it's game over (duh). In solo-play if you die with bots still alive, the game is still over. There's about 7 maps as standard. 4 difficulties: casual, easy, normal and insane. Insane is fun :)4 classes:Pointman: Auto-shotty. Good burst damage. Need to be ammo conservative. Respect the support use your frag nades wisely.Support: Gives everyone ammo. Be nice to support when asking them to deploy resupplies. Make sure the use resupply. The box can be used to block doors.Assault: Sustained damage with heavy AR. Throws frag nades. Don't worry too much about ammo, there's plenty.Sniper: Semi-auto sniper. Incendiary grenades very important to block off choke points. 2nd most important class imho. Use your nades to cover the technicians when they move their sentries. Your teammates don't et damaged by the fire but you do.Technician: Pump action-shotty. Places sentries to cover hallways. Sentry is invaluable. Protect it with your life. If it dies and you are not near the end of the game... die to respawn with one. Master the art of death. I cannot stress how important the technician and the sentry is. It wins games. Never leave the technician behind. Protect him and the sentry with your life. However, don't camp with the sentry. You always have to move up and reposition. Sentry is good defensively and offensively when pushing/holding hallways.The one time I really enjoyed this game is when I got teamed up with a guy that was willing to work in a team. With the class system every class has a crucial role but there was only 2 of us. He was sniper and I was Technician. The technician can place sentries to cover hall ways and buy time to the team to move forward. The sniper can throw incendiary nades to block off choke points and buy time for the technician to move the sentry up into a new position. Together was finished a level and that was very satisfying. Sometimes when you are in a game with 6 people you would still lose because some people undervalue a good sniper and technician who are usually behind covering the back of the team. Stick as a team and win the game. Moments like these are few and far inbetween so enjoy them.\n",
      "Really cool mod. It's fun to play this with your friends.\n",
      "Awesome game. Fun with co-op friends. It's challenging, alot of puzzles to solve, and over all smooth game play.\n",
      "MAN! This game has got to be my most favourite game of all time (you can probably tell from the amount of hours played :D). It is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides. This content includes downloadable maps, weapons, vehicles and more from the in - game workshop and plentiful servers to play on. I would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money. Pros  A workshop that contains TONS of varied addons to download Plentiful servers to join  Plentiful gamemodes to play Very good game to play with friends (especially on certain maps) It is extremely funny because of the physics and addons The game runs easily, even if you have a bad computer  You can spawn in things other people have made  Cons  The graphics aren't amazing but acceptable The servers on Gmod use a lot of CSS (Counter Strike Source) textures, meaning that you need to buy CSS to see the textures. Although, you don't need to do this but it is recommended because it will enhance the experience For new players, setting up a private server to play with friends may be hard (I watched tutorials on YouTube on how to do it) Some addons take a while to download (especially the larger file size addons) and servers that you join require you to download the server's addons / content. Although, it really depends on the speed of your internet if it's going to be fast or slow.Overall this game is worth it and it's only $10 ........ $10 FREAKIN BUCKS!!!!!!! :DGmod receives a final overall score of 8/10\n",
      "Please, if you're considering getting this game because it looks like your thing, try not to be too put out by the bad reviews as there is alot of fun to be had so long as you're playing with friends.I feel as through the game is as complete as it needs to be in order to have fun online, with friends. The perks are basically 8 unique play styles which become more rewarding as you progress and I agree with the community that some of the perks are not well implemented.I remember the origional horribly buggy Unreal Tournament 2004 mod which is launched with a .bat file and Tripwire have turned it into a very nice looking, atmospheric game with nice mechanics. The weapons are fun to handle and the 200fps animations for them make the slo-mo \"zed time\" visuals look epic.The micro-transactions are pretty similar to CS:GO, only there if you care with no effect on gameplay.Sometimes a perk has in the past had fairly dissapointing bonuses, and Tripwire have been VERY slow in recognising the flaws and finding alternative bonuses which make the perk more viable.If you live in Australia like I do, there are not many servers since there are no ad spaces so companies have no incentive to host them over here but there are definately enough to get by.TL, DR: I have fun playing this and I wish the community was bigger, especially in Australia because despite tripwire they should eventually get it right\n",
      "Now when you boot up a game called 'Undertale' you half expect it to be about an underdog. Well there were certainly dogs. I was not disappointed. From dogs to 'temmies' to weird turtles hanging out in caves and handing out sea tea to random children... Undertale is a game of discovery and wonder. The game where you 'don't have to kill anyone' is merely twisting the truth, however. I was most definitely forced to kill my sides. In fact, my sides were brutally murdered since I died laughing; I was questioning my sexuality at one turn and my moral values at the next. One would think such a 'retro' game wouldn't have much replayability. In this instance, one would be incredibly stupid since the average player plays through this entire thing three times. Why? Because of the dog song. Perhaps it's also got to do with the fact that the developers decided to use not one, but THREE main storylines for their game. But I think it's the dog song, personally. Not only is this the first time I've ever seen someone appropriately use the Comic Sans font, even if it is on a boneheaded character, but the game is also host to one of the most appealing and charming casts I've ever seen in a 'mostly' child-friendly game. My first playthrough left me with satisfaction overflowing from my robotic-gameshow-host-shaped-heart, and at the end of my second, I was not crying but had merely caught something in my eyes. That something was tears. Now, with my third and final playthrough ahead of me, I am brimming with excitement. I am a mouse, and I'm so close to the cheese. The thought that one day I'll leave my hole and finally taste that cheese of victory through the finalisation of this game fills me with something. It fills me with... determination.\n",
      "Life can be good, but there's a problem. You can't murder your friends in real life. That's where Battleblock Theatre comes into play. If you've ever wished you could pick up your friend and chuck them into a giant laser beam that has the intensity of the sun then A) please don't try it at home, and B) buy this game before performing C, C) try this at home. An almost equally fun aspect of Battleblock Theatre is the sophisticated and mature narration which takes place. For example: 'Just run like you've got diarreah, and it's starting to come out... a little bit.' The dark and brooding story of cat overlords and the sinking of your extremely happy friendship ship has obviously left you so mentally scarred that you NEED to kill your friends (just go with it, it's as good an excuse as any). I've never been made more bloodthirsty by such a brightly coloured game. 10/10 would murder for friendship again.\n",
      "If there were ever a way to make the murder of hundreds of innocent villagers child-friendly and guilt free, it's this game. It's a true wonder from my childhood that, because I've researched atheism in the past, has another two-hundred and eighty four years left before it wins me the game. Thankfully, my understanding of the possibility that god isn't real has also allowed me to hire spies for a far cheaper price. All that's left is to figure out why. In the meantime though, I can safely say that Age of Empires is a well-balanced and realistic game where seige rams move faster than racecars when full of armoured soldiers, and you can set fire to buildings with swords and javelins. Perhaps even better, the longbowmen can hit a castle and the castle do a thing about it, because only the British know how to get a bow, and make another one using a bigger stick. Thankfully there are counters to these longbowmen. You know those guys who come to your door and want to talk about Jesus? They annoy the enemies so much in this game that the enemies will actually join your side to shut them up. Just hire on of them to ask that pesky longbowmen 'Wolololo' (that roughly translates to 'Sir, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and saviour Jesus Christ?') and he'll be shooting YOUR enemies castle faster than you can say 'I serve the anti-christ'. Just make sure that your guy has other guys spurring him on with encouraging chants, because those chants can heal arrow wounds. Just like they thought magic words and chants could heal fatal wounds in ancient times, they actually can in this game. The joy doesn't end there though; there's everything from villagers able to kill armed calvary to seige ongars that will happily crush the people who should be operating them. Speaking of which, no one has to man the seige weapons. How great is medieval AI!? 10/10 would wolololo enemy troops again.\n",

      "A friend and I were sitting in the far barracks in the North-West Airfield, after walking through and finding that someone had gotten there first, sharing what little we had found. Low on food and water, but not so much on ammunition, we decided that we'd head south and loot some towns.We jogged out of the barracks, with me leading, only to see a zombie standing just outside one of the hangar doors. Before I could even say \"I got this\" the crack of sniper rounds whizzed through the air. Turns out that the zombie was in fact a trigger happy bandit, who was about as accurate as a blind stormtrooper. And so a intense firefight insued, consisting mostly of paranoia and blind firing. After finally filling the stormtrooper bandit with more M4 than was necessary, one of his friends showed up, and turned out to be much more accurate. A much more intense firefight insued, with me getting shot twice and my friend being brutally mudered infront of my eyes. It was then that I thought it would be a good idea to see if I could talk to the stormtooper's friend.As it turns out we both thought that the other was a bandit, with the only actual bandit was trigger-happy-stormtrooper. Whilst that made him a bandit by association, he was apparently trying to convince Mr. Stormtrooper to stop his bandit ways, so I forgave him. We helped one another as best we could, then ended up looting my friend, huddling around his corpse like a warm fire (seeing as the stormtrooper's corpse had so many bullets in it all of his gear was ruined).I waved goodbye to stormtrooper's psychiatrist and we went on our merry ways. Confused as to why the guy that shot my friend was one of the friendliest players in DayZ. I also decided to wear one of the bright blue UN berets, to further prevent mix ups, as a sign that I'm friendly, or so that it's easier to shoot me in the head.\n",
      "So this is a story of me and my friend messing around on Terraria:Me: Where are you going?Friend: On an adventure to find nothing and die.10/10 would grind again\n",
      "The game concept perfectly fits your tight knit group of friends  with the express intention of grappling with the game's core mechanics of monster hunting and taming within a server or game you host privately. All other means of playing the game can be extremely difficult or impossible to have fun with save for singleplayer for people like me who are also just fine with solo play. Solo play's novelty does not wear off completely at play times, but it quickly dissipates until you can find it palatable once again.The following are personal opinions from multiplayer:Open servers can be divided between two categories: - Tame PVE servers that provide little opportunities for new players as nearly all sustainable locations are gratuitously occupied in large scales by a small percentage of older players by placing one piece of cheap fort structure to expand vacant and useful locations. Lack of available and sustainable locations to start means you will as a new visitor of an existing server will often die too fast before you are able to make any meaningful progress save for a grindey levelling system that is only made less fun and more time consuming by the limitations imposed by other older and more wealthier players.- Hostile PVP servers where the same problems of PVE exist and where new players will get targetted almost guarantee. Dying to both other players and other entities increased in magnitudes. Earlier and more established player groups dictate the meta and the limitations of new players or those who wish to play the game for its mechanics and less for the meta dictated by others. Much like real life, in order to have \"fun\", or rather function in this digital society you need to join tribes to succeed, but not in your own terms. There is nothing wrong with team play, but you will have to learn to be completely subservient to a few and be constantly worried about their \"authority\" (and beyond just common manners and courtesy not to mess with other people's stuff) in public server.I recommend that if you are intent with multiplayer online, find private ones. Most of the time they tell you quickly how the server operates and is much less of a wild west. If it's a PVE server, they are often not as populated and more space to enjoy yourself, and pvp, not really much difference to public server. If pvp is your deal, then the value proposition is there.Can't recommend it to a few, but neither can I tell others to avoid the game completely.\n",
      "TF2 is a great game. And being free, what more can we ask :DThere is a great variety of items (hats, weapons, miscs, etc) that you can customise and show to your friends, family, and everyone else in the world who are also playing at the same time.The Steam market deeply helps fellow TF2 players to sell their items at a reasonable price, in order to get other games, and/or items.There are many different choices of maps, and servers alike.

If you're looking for something very realistic this might not be for you, but if you just want to duel some friends or jump in a 1 for all servers and go ham i say give this game a shot \"FOR THE ORRDDDEERRRR\"\n",
      "One of my favourite games and even after over 1500 hours i am still not bored of it You are able to play this with 2 different mindsets: 1. Serious  +Probably one of the best team competitive shooter's out there  +It has great game mechanics, countless different strategies and teamplay, a lot of skill and a pile of interesting maps (ie, dust 2, dust 2 and dust 2)  + It has one of the major esport competitive games with many fans and lots of pro teams to follow+ Not a simple game by any means (has a high skill ceiling). There is tones to master and learn in the game. Just the shooting has a lot to it; the ideal uses of each different gun and its different spray pattern (Yes, unlike COD the gun has recoil). There is also a lot to learn about the various maps, common prefiring spots, different smokes, grenades and flashes etc. You can also infinately increase your game sense and just overal experience.   2. Not serious (Troll)  + You can play with a lobby of friends and just have a blast  + The in game chat can let you hear the best of stories, shout never ending insults and of course simply take the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone (especially twelvies)  + There are so many private servers if you are sick of the main game modes making it very hard for you to get bored of this game. (there are: surf, death run, 1v1, zombies, bhop, dodgeball and countless other servers)  + Even in the competitive gamemode you can have a lot of fun without playing very seriously with the sole intent to win. You can mess about and have fun with \"strat roulette\", run around getting rowdy and being idiots with your team, attempt ninja defuses or faze shots. Not to mention getting a zues, knife or nade/flash/smoke kill is pretty damn satisfying. No matter if you want to play this game seriously or not there is so much to enjoy and i would definately recommend this to all multiplayer fps lovers, and just gamers in general.\n",
      "Decent zombie game although linear graphics is still got enough content to keep me playing it for a few days and I would recommend playing with a friend because by yourself can get boring pretty fast the amount hackers is reasonable only got hit by one once and it was annoying but he got banned pretty fast which i like to see.\n",
      "First off, the customisation of characters is extremely limited, with three different shirts, pairs of shoes and hairstyles (The difference between hairstyles is colour), which dissappointed me greatly, but wasn't a game breaker. My friend and had a laugh with the emotes and the quite feminine dancing, but it would have been better if the same song wouldn't repeat as we played the same difficulty level. The walking in the lobby is clunky and unresponsive making moving difficult. The music isn't great, but it isn't bad. The main gameplay is difficult to say the least. You have to practice several times at least to get the average beat. Some levels are impossible however, such as 10 star, which I don't believe is meant to be finished.Overall I would rate this game 6/10 as it is, but dancing enthusiasts may rate it higher. More work must be done to make this game complete.\n",
      "A fun game to play with friends, with strategic elements that need to be paid attention to, but are easy to control, even for new players. The game becomes slow as it progresses, so make sure you have some time on your hands for extended play sessions. Either way a great buy. Even better with DLC if you can spare the money.\n",
      "A fun and hectic co-op shooter, that can be a walk in the park, or be challenging and tedious, depending on what difficulty you play, and your playstyle - sticking together is essential. Destroy your anger as you satisfyingly rip through hordes of the infected with melee weapons, try your marksmanship with the rifles, and test your resilience in defence sections.Be warned! If you don't play with friends your experience will be hindered, as the AI's prescence won't be felt, but surviving with three friends can lead to a heroic last stand as they escape, and leave you for dead...Very fun, 9/10.\n",
      "A fun strategy game with decent graphics, good gameplay and easy progression. The campaign is there, though I have found that playing multiplayer with friends, both competitively and coop, makes up the majority of this game.\n",
      "Space Engineers is an amazing space exploration game (now planetary exploration), as i played the beta i was suprised by its amazing unique features that other games have not seemed to scratch the surface of, most of these voxel open sandbox games get boring after a set of hours but with space enginners the set of hours has not been reached yet, although its fun building and driving machines, the grind to build may be tedious for players with low tolerance.I loved space engineers at first with the amazing concept and gameplay although now im lead to dissapointment as it cannot run at the same settings it was, as i use to get an eazy 60fps on 900p but now. i stuggle to get above 10fps will minimal settings @ 720p which has angered me and unable to play the game at all in some instances where the game would instantly crash. although the game is amazing and the concept is smart. Space Engineers has deteriated in performance for not just my rig but others with high end rigs stuggling to hit 30fps in 1080p (medium settings). its a shame to see such an amazing game become unplayable and not fun to open to play with friends as you will always end up crashing the server due to bugs or unable to controll you character due to frame rate <10.i loved this game in beta and i wish i was able to recomend this (which i could if it was the same game it was last year) but at its current build with its current features and issues i cannot as the updates break the game further and further.

      " PRO'S - Near same mechanics as csgo with bhops- Great game to play with friends - Only puts you down 2c ( When on sale )- When your fists are stronger than the gun you spawn with- The unrealistic ragdoll when you punch the zombies face in. Which is pretty fun- You can punch zombies from your car even when you're driving- You can use anything as a weapon CON'S - Guns are still broken to the ♥♥♥♥ house, its a minigun-shotgun-singleshot-bolt action-rifle or a mag-7 from csgo- The black zombies spawning on your head ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the crap out of you- How fast the black zombies run- You cant sneak into town to get supplys because most zombies spawn on you- The car sounds dont fade in or out then just snap in- You look at the zombies and they die for no reason- The spelling is terrible( I personally recommend this game )\n",

      "This game is very fun when you play with friends, the combat is really fun and the building is my personal favorite part of this game (besides rading of course) I would recommend this game but only if you have friends to play it with!!UPDATED REVIEW:Game is enjoyable at certain times but that only comes at the peak of the grind. combat is slugish and this is somthing that i personally found but all of the Australian servers have been taken over by chinese witch is weird cause they just shout CHINA NUMBA 1!!!\n",
      "As your ship enters an unexplored system you are greeted by a vastly superior pirate fleet, waiting in ambush.You panic, your shields buying you precious seconds to choose an escape route.With the last of your fuel you make a blind jump forward, hoping to land in friendly space.You are dismayed as your ship enters an empty system, a dead end with pirates close behind you.In panic, you scan for a planet you can land on, hoping to hide from the pirates.Your ship veers to the side as it detects a large anomoly, its only identification as \"????\"The Pirates, outspeeding you, strafe your freighter as you limp your way towards the tear in spaceWith your shields down and injured, you enter only to find yourself in a completely different system, but one still as empty as the last.Shipwrecked, you scan the local channels for neighbouring vessels when you come across whole fleets of alien ships you had never seen before.

      "The type of game that could make you rip you hair off with its EXTREMELY DIFFICULT levels. What could be more frustrating? Playing with your friends! Struggle your way through the levels with your friends (Up to 4 players) as all of you try to beat the levels. (Team-killing is allowed) Still a fun game to have a good laugh with your friends!\n",

      "In its prime MW2 was Amazing, With friends it could of been the best fun you have ever had playing a PC game. But from 2010-2012 many hackers, Quickscopers and noob tubers made the game frustrating. Nowdays the game is still populated decetly and most of the Hackers have moved on to more recent cods. In 2009 i would of highly reccomended this game, But now you would probably not enjoy getting killed over and over if your a lvl 1. If you can find it for a cheap price buy it, if not maybe buy a recent shooter.\n",
      "Payday 2 is the sequel to Payday: The Heist by Overkill Software. Payday 2 overall brings back the intense bank robbery feel from the first instalment, but triples the fun. With features such as mask/weapon customization and the card rewards system, payday 2 becomes a very addicting and enjoyable experience. Payday 2 is meant to be played with friends. Yes, the game does offer single player bots, but they are very frustrating and, in most circumstances, useless. If you have a group of 2-3 friends to play with, this game is a blast, if you like playing single player I don't recommend it. The newly released DLC \"Payday 2: Armoured Transport\" adds a lot more content to the game, such as new heists, masks and weapons (plus extra customization options). The new dlc brings faith to the buyer that content for this game is still coming, and in big chunks. Overall i highly recommend payday 2, it is an action packed rollercoaster of a game that will bring you and your friends hours of cop killing joy.\n",

      "What about this game? Well In general it's a Great Game.What's great about it? Well let's start off with the type of player you are.Basically I probably Just split to 3.If you are the type of guy/girl that loves to play a game for it's customization (Wink Wink Me) and obviously play shooter games in general (FPS/3rdPS) then APB:Reloaded has done it right. The shapes they provide is not alot but enough for you to find shapes to go to your design. Of coaurse this comes with a draw back which is the ammount of shapes you can put in. Where you have to get premium in order to get the best experience.I'm sure there are players who Just want to play it and meet friends depending on the other party If he/she is friendly and wants to make new friends or just plain playing with friends for the fun of it like CS:GO then this is also probably for those type of people,There are also the players that wanted to get GTA V BUT can't afford it. APB:Reloaded is another small game Just like it and for those players to enjoy. Sure you won't get the full experience of how GTA V actually plays. But it's close enough that people who play GTA:SA will stay in the game for a couple of months.Those to me is what make APB:Reloaded a Great Game to me. BUT Obviously there are drawbacks.The Animations/World/Lighting arn't the best BUT It will do just fine. Even tho Reloaded Productions Keeps teasing us about the new Engine or Lighting.........\n",
      "Alright Buckle Up kidlets.TL:DR ----This game is the game you wanna get if you are willing to be chokeholded and dragged through a rich and deep story driven game.I sat down and spent 13.5 hours playing this game from start to finish. Binged it. All day.I highly recommend this game.-Onto the meat-To be honest I did not know what to expect. Especially when I played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey first before playing this one. I didnt even know it was part of a series to recently. As soon as it went on sale in stea, it was the best decision ever to buy it.Playing the second game first doesnt spoil much. But you will be like \"Ohhhh\" with some places and remember. Which was what happened to me throughout the game.I did love playing this game very much so. Some parts you will get stuck and cannot figure out what to do. But paying close attention to absolutely  everything is the key. I know some might phase out after a while.But I do reccommend you play this in one sitting whilst everything is still fresh in your mind so do not forget places or what you need to do.Always check your diary, It is your best friend.Other than that. I highly reccommend this game to anyone and everyone. Well worth the money and well worth the time!!\n",

      "Crashes and lots of bugs. Nevertheless, it may be fun to play with friends. I fully understand that this is a modification and it is unstable even on High-end PCs.\n",
      "I remember waiting for this game a few years ago when it was first announced and my friend and I were looking forward to it coming out, then remembering it got delayed for a whole year and we had to wait for what felt like forever. After getting the game, it was fantastic. Looked beautiful (which is suprising for a game set in an apocalypse-like situation) but obviously graphic-wise it was and still is pretty stunning. Have played a fair amount of this game as you can see. The DLC called \"The Following\" was an excellent addition to the game however it really only added another 7 missions but at least it was in a whole new area with driveable vehicles. All the DLC together has added about another 100+ hours to my gameplay just by trying to do all the side missions, etc.Recommend this game to any zombie-thriller / survival fans out there. However once you play for about 25 hours it might start seeming a little boring and after the campaigns are done basically it felt to me like there was no worth anymore.Goodnight. And Good luck fellow survivors.\n",
      "I haven't played this game for that long and there's a reason for that.It is probably the worst game I have played in terms of how it runs, and mainly being the bugs and glitches. I just bought it and was so excited until I couldn't even launch the game. I finally fixed that issue, which then lead to another issue. The screen resolution was set to 320x240 (something like that, not even sure because I couldn't read anything on the screen. I had steam notifications popping up telling me my friends were playing a game and the notification would cover the entire screen After a while of mucking about I finally fixed that, so again, I was happy to get started. Once I started the game, I joined a random server, my graphics were set to highest and so the detail is pretty good but there is a lot of work to be done (glad I'm not developing it), there were some rendering issues and magically disappearing zombies, amongst many other things....Long story short, I have given up for now and will wait until the full version is announced until I keep playing this game.Also, I do know that this is alpha and it is expected to have many issues. I'm simply saying that I wouldn't really bother to get it now if I were you as it (for me), is almost unplayable. :(\n",
      "It is still too early to recommend buying this game. I know it is a beta and has not even come out as a proper game but this is the exact reason why I don't recommend it as of yet. This is due to many bugs and glitches that occur, such as walking through objects which can get you stuck inside the object, combat can be unresponsive at times, and a lot more than just these examples. Apart from this, I do find the game fun to play especially with friends or a team. Food and supplies are scarce so it is quite challenging to scour the land to find such things. Massive map so far that could even expand a lot larger. I'd have to say 50/50 with this game. I like it because of the fun and experience you get from it, but moreso that I don't because of the attention the game needs on fixing bugs and the like.\n",

      "Skyrim, to me Skyrim is one of the best games I had ever played. I had a hard time picking which races to play as, I eventually pick a race called \"Nord\" and I finish the game with this race.Storyline: To me Skyrim's storyline was every: interesting, different and truly difficult in many ways. But, the storyline could have more detail, in my opinon.Also the storyline, to me was so long which I liked because later, in the game I understand, what it was trying to say or relate to.Characters: This game, has many \"different\" characters such as: crazy, happy, mad and sad. Game of Skyrim made this so we can relate this to the our world... Which to I was enjoyable that the makers of this game put lots affect in the game to make it more real like.Followers: I loved the idea that there was followers in the game like: Dogs, Horses, Wife, Husband and NPC (Humans). It made it like you won't alone or afriad and that you could go in the deepest of caves, ruins or something like that.I, Recommend this game to all my friend because its fun, interesting and a lot different to other games...\n",

      "If you read my other review for Toy Soldiers: Complete, then sadly this review is going to be the complete opposite. Toy Soldiers: War Chest is simple not worth the money that it asks for £11.99 (for the standard game) and £24.99 (for the hall of fame addition). Although it includes characters from different franchises you have to pay £3.99 for the privilage of owning that character - such as GI Joe and Cobra which is a real kick in the teeth! But the game forces you to do this as the basic armies are crap! The only playable basic army is the WW1 German Army, the rest are boring, stupid and a waste of time. On top this the game is meant for a console, you can't control aircraft because they do a million flips if you sneeze or move around (plus they are so weak!), the gameplay is repetative and boring, additionally none of your friends have the game or players who have the game don't do multiplayer.To Conclude:if you are looking for the following items in this gameNo or limited funBad/Mediocre reviews (check out gamespot or ign if you don't believe me)Expensive (£11.99 standard or +£3.99 for DLC or £24.99 for FULL Game)Lacking in gameplayLacking in friends and other human being who play this game!4 base armies - Only 1 playableMICROTRANSACTIONS -game currencyUPLAY the most pointless and worst system if to be invented by mankind!

      "Early Access ReviewThe road so far...Ark Survival Evolved has its flaws currently as all day one games in EA, but it has a lot of potential, It has a deep levelling and crafting system, requiring time and effort in gathering and crafting, It's combat is kind of clunky but once you unlock that slingshot you'll never go back to just bashing a dinosaur , while I haven’t manage to tame a dinosaur yet ( started to tame a carno that had attacked my house, but when I went to kill a couple of the massive turtle dinosaur's they wrecked my house and the passed out carno :C )  I think it’s an amazing and fun, engaging mechanics making you care for that one pet you will value over the rest. So far only the graphics to play this are letting it down in my opinion (my specs below.)  I hope with more optimization and when DX12 comes out soon it will get a lot better. To list this out.Pro’sDeep rewarding crafting System.levelling system.Massive open world full of horrors and thing's that want you for food.Fun tribe system with friends.Solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online.Dev's actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one.Con'sRequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards.Some small physics bugs e.g. body's flying and being tossed away abit.Mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics.But after all that I’ll keep playing it, because I so far find this the most enjoyable Survival game out.Computer Spec'sProcessor.Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz Graphics Card.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ram.Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It's installed & I've played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I've loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev's are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this.\n",

Holey Crap.Plus, if you are Germany, you instantly win like wtf man and the hit detection and ranking thing and the friends system are all just bulls**t. Plus, you always get a connection problem if your internet is not the best.NEVER PLAY THIS GAME EVER OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.\n",
      "The gameplay alone is amazing.  The entire concept of having to be on board a ship full of murderers including yourself makes this rich, as well as having it very well balanced.  the fact that it adds many variables that you need to keep in check on top of killing adds difficulty and immersion to the game, and there's many opportunities for you to kill people as well as get killed. It's splendid and I'd recommend it if you can play LAN with a couple friends. My only gripe is the fact that there are no more dedicated servers to host multiplayer matches.  I hate this because playing with real people makes it more intense as you need to think who may be a real person or an AI, and it's a lot more fun to kill someone knowing they'll have a reaction.  On top of that; the games AI isn't very smart either.  They'll hardly ever attack you, or sometimes it's easy to know that they're hunting you. Still it's a great game and with how cheap it is with sales it's worth it for the experience.\n",

Raids are the greatest thing ever3. good community4.shadow dungeons are reallly rewarding and even though a lot of people  complain about the long grind to get into one i think it makes the dungeon that much more fun and important.5. not a single pay to win feature, there is ingame cash but only used on small unimportant things6. there is nothing better in this universe then se... i mean finding your first resplendant piece of gear which is truly amazing7. playing with friends doubles the fun.8. ringcrafting is grindy but rewardingCons:1. not many abilities, there are a lot of classes but each one has like 2/3 abilities2. a bit laggy for anyone in oceana3. despite the good player base, chat is completely filled with people asking to join a club because trove made it a quest to do that, so everyone is asking around trying to find a club to join so they can move on with the game.4. does get a bit grindy after lvl 10 and the chance of finding better loot then what you have becomes a lot slower then levelling wich is already a drag, this basically means once you get to around uber 1/2 you will be stuck there for ages not finding anything better then what you haveOverveiw:there are a lot more pros to list but i want to go play trove now so cant be bothered writing it, this game is easily the most fun ive had in months.\n",

So you drag yourself to the kitchen, open the fridge, grab the mustard, pull down your pants and go to work. What you didn't realise is that it felt amazing.

They really balanced out the game so that its not a mindless slaughter (looking at you Nether) But is still a pvp game.The player interactions were good fun (when they are not screaming friendly at the top of their lungs while running away.)But the amount of bugs is almost unforgiveable.Currently I have one where every 5 minutes I get 1-5 fps and can barely move.

      "The devs started on a new Engineers game before finishing this one. But what is here is worth $25 assuming you have friends around to play with. Everything in this game is time consuming. Its not minecraft where its simply pick up and put down. It goes something like Harvest/Mine/Gather/Whatever > Process into desired material > create the block (weld and stuff) and then finally place it. Physics are nice. The player animation for flying is a bit weird and awkward but i cant think of anything to replace it with. Workshop has plenty of addons to download. Have Fun\n",

Over a hundred heroes all free to play and to master, only use of money is cosmetics which has no actual effect on the gameplay itself, only giving the hero a unique look, this is my most played and favourite game and i dont see myself getting bored of it anytime soon. 10/10Edit: 2564 hours in still not bored\n",

There is soo much to do in this game, whether it be trying to tame a dinosaur you want or building a bridge to link the many forts and homes you will build. I have never experienced playing the game on the EPIC settings but I have seen a few YouTubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great! Now you may be wondering why I have not recommended the game, that is due to the many problems that ARK faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation, the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my RAM and spit it back out at me, I have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all I see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friend's PCs. On multiple forum posts and other friend's first hand experiences I have heard memory leaks of up to 23 GBs! Not very healthy for a computer if you ask me :P All in all ARK: Survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly, I cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a HIGH-end computer, but if you really want to play this game I recommend that you atleast have 16 GBs of RAM available if you want to run the game with mods.EDIT: I also forgot to mention that ARK: Survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times I have ever seen, so if you are fortunate enough to have an SSD with some room on it then install ARK on there.\n",
      "Great game to play with friends but if you are a Killing Floor 1 \"vet\" than I would hold off on buying this until they balance the skill trees abit and until they add abit more content.\n",
      "Excelent game in my opinon, practically my most played game, sinking many hours in to its gameplay mechanics and friendly community. 10/10\n",
      "Quite a dissapointment to what was shown on the trailers.A huge \"Pay to win\" fest, You will be surprised on what you can do for free... not very muchOverall the gameplay is nice, Playing against other players either as Police or the Criminals brings fun and competitive gameplay.The customisation is lacking unless you pay real money...Unless you play with friends this game becomes a huge dissapointment to quickly.\n",

      "I can't really call myself a true Resident Evil fan, I've only recently managed to play Resident Evil 4 and have never played any of the original games (I.E Resident Evil 1-3). I will go ahead now and say I rather enjoy this game quite a bit, it's certainly got enough charm for a quick game every now and then but it doesn't have the lasting draw that most other RE games have. Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City did some things right, but did quite a lot at a mediocre level and some things plain badly, so I'll tell you what i think, and you can decide for yourself.The Good -The Character design: The characters and most enemies in this game are quite varied in appearance and personality, and I like that. Mainly I'm talking about Wolf Pack here, they each have an interesting back-story that is never mentioned in-game (you'll need an external source like a wikia for that) and they all look unique and interesting. Personally if they were a little more developed I wouldn't mind seeing them in other games.-The Music: I'll say now regardless of how one-sided my opinion is, I love the music in the game. It's a mix of atmospheric tones to intense dramatic symphonies, all of them fit their respective situations perfectly.The Okay-The Cover mechanics: Cover in this game is a bit iffy, some things you can hide behind others you can't sometimes you can shoot from cover sometimes you can't. It's kinda like rolling the dice with your health and that's never a good thing.-The Combat mechanics: Combat is arguably the main aspect of RE:ORC, and when the main aspect of the game isn't the best part of the game, you're not in for a good time. Recoil feels almost non-existent but bullet spread is a pain to manage, especially with the less accurate weapons. The meele combat is okay, however performing executions and special moves is unresponsive and it usually takes multiple attempts to perform one.The Bad- Enemy design : Enemies in this game can be easily described with the term \"bullet sponge\". They all take a hell of a lot of ammo to kill and that's not helping the face you hardly have any to begin with. This isn't a problem when it comes to the slow and easy to deal with zombies, but when faced with enemy humans, hunters and lickers it becomes a huge problem and is even more apparent in the harder difficulties. Additionally shooting enemies hardly causes them to react, they just take it like nothing has happened most of the time which is frustrating when it comes to already hard to kill enemies like the hunters or the final boss depending on what choice you make.- The Story: Not much to say here, even for a spin off title in an alternate reality the story of this game is really weak and boring with no real development of characters.All in all, RE:ORC is a game that's fun with friends, but not worth the given price-tag. Give it a shot if you can ever get it cheaper but don't expect to be amazed by the game.\n",

      "Game wise, it is a good MOBA game. Graphics and the other things were good and very detailed textures, but the gameplay is just amazing. In fact, this is one of my 1st MOBA game I ever played. Compared to the other MOBA genre, DOTA2 is much harder compared to both games (denying creeps, creep block, losing gold when you're dead, you can't do this in League nor SMITE. I've tried).Cosmetics in this game does exist, and can be creatively customized. Characters, yes, this is the reason i fell in love with DOTA2. It is variative (ranging to a dwarf, into a BDSM-loving MILF, also furries). Aside from their lores and design, they have special interactions against other character (ex. CM and Lina), in which both games lacked (although on League, they started to do that on several heroes).The only downside is quite repetitive. Game modes (mostly, not counting the unofficial servers) are 5v5 only, even the other MOBA game competitors like LoL and SMITE have various gameplay. Cosmetics were confusing, because it is divided into several parts.And also, i forgot to mention one thing that (some) everyone hates in this game, but this makes the game famous.Community (make it EU or SEA)As a closing word, I strongly recommend you to play this game (if you want something more challenging than LoL or SMITE).Try playing DOTA with friends, it'll enhance the gameplay more.\n",
      "Fun Game, lots of modes, great way to show off to your friends, also a good way to tease them too.\n",
      "There's quite a few things that can be said about Farming Simulator 2013. I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.Essentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.The graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.The physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.Once again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved. In final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get. You're in charge of your own wallet here.\n",
      "Such a fun game. So many different things to do and fun to have with friends!\n",
      "Very nice game, thought it would be a tad more realistic and accurate to WW2 but still fun to play with friends. Germany ftw!\n",
      "Overall a very fun survival game that is constantly getting updated and improved. The feedback from the developers are spot on, as they take almost every feedback towards the updates. The multiplayer is also very fun as you can fully interact with your friends in-game. However there is a downside to this game, gameplay optimization still isn't very satisfying to look at right now although it is to be expected for an early access game. Definitely get this game and support the developers, you will not regret it.\n",
      "This gameis so fun to play with a group of friends\n",
      "Very fun game when playing with friends. You are able to put addons to the game which make it more fun, it comes with singleplayer and multiplayer (online & lan play).\n",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrGC86PY3ksI bought this game on a whim because it was only $2.50 in a Steam sale. This is one of the best impulse purchases I have ever made, the game is extremely fast paced and rewards learning the levels. It is not unfair like some other 2D platformers that try to be hard for the sake of being hard, this game is very fun and satisfying to play. Controller is highly recommended. You go down a certain number of floors in the tower then fight a randomly selected boss for that level, by performing certain actions during gameplay you can unlock extra weapons & items which randomly drop as you kill enemies. I gifted this to another friend of mine and we both absolutely love it and played it nonstop for the next couple nights (there is no multiplayer though). The music is really cool and the art while basic is quite nice to look at while everything flies past in a blur :)I definitely recommend picking this up in a sale, you won't regret it.\n",
      "Completely free game, kicks ♥♥♥! They should sell this game it's so good. Comes with map editor & you can mod the files if you are hosting your own server so I imagine this will be supported by the community for quite some time. If you haven't got it already download it and get some friends together for a good time. The game only comes with one campaign which you can finish in a few hours but it is fun and as I said, there is a map editor so you can download many more off the Steam forums or other places.\n",
      "Great game just cause 2 has a great edition beacuse it has a free dlc witch allows multiplayer and i a tone of fun with friends!\n",
      "I have had this game for not long and have been addicted to it. if anyone wants to play with me just send me a friend requese. this game is in alpha but there aren't many bugs\n",
      "Awwwhhhh m8! Met great friends on Garry's Mod and have spent a lot of my useless life on it :D\n",
      "Once upon a time I had a life, then I was intoduced to this marvelous spectacle known as Team Fortress 2 and completely ruined it. This MMOFPS is amazing I've played over 1000 hours so far and can't get enough of it. Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game and is extremely addictive, complete and loaded with action this is a great game for all gamers because it's free. Unique weponary to choose from, intriguing gamplay, customisable characters and multiple game types to play on this game will not disappoint you. 9/10WARNING: side effects of this game may include: having no life  losing money on crates losing friends and obsession for hats\n",
      "Awesome game, you could get hours of fun out of this is you played through the game with every charcter, as you have to play differently with each one. The game is Best played with friends.With a keyboard and mouse, I found it a bit dodgy (sometimes slow between when I press a button to actually doing something on screen), with a controller however (I used some software that let me use my ps3 controller on my PC) it was fine, with no lag, just as if I was playing it on a console. Good stuff!\n",
      "This is a really fun game but not many people play zombies at all i think no one does it would make it a much better game to play with people across the world on zombies and make friends. But you cant cause there is no people playing zombies and more people playing multiplayer version of black ops.\n",
      "Left 4 Dead 2 is critically acclaimed by a lot of people but I didn't find it all that, like so many other people. But to its credit it's fun to play (But only so long as you have friends, single player is boring really), its very mod friendly with tons of mods you can download and use from skins for your characters and weapons to redone animations to fully fledged levels so if you are the type of person who enjoys that sort of thing then this is a game for you.Not really my thing considering I almost never play it with friends ever, but if you have a good abundance of friends whom you play a lot of games with, this is certainly a title worth considering.\n",
      "People are overeacting to this game. Sure it's one of the best Local Multiplayer games out there (one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had), but it's not worth it's price. I thought this game would have more content but it's definitely not worth it's base price $15, or $10, or barely even $5 for that matter. I expected the singleplayer mode to have way more in it and they should really mention that it's not worth it at all. It's definitely one of the most frustrating things I've played. It's more like a challenge mode, revealling bits of background story but it's just gameplay. If you get this game, you get it for the fun couch-deathmatches. That's the main purpose of this game. The trials and singleplayer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It should be replaced with a practice mode. And bring some friends and controlllers. Four of them. It's the only way to play multiplayer/properly. Keyboard sucks and eventually hurts after a while. I definitely DO NOT recommend unless it's on sale.\n",
      "God damn I hate source engine games. Why couldn't we just connect to a friend instead of having to open ports or opening hamachi?\n",
      "Accurate representation of my life. Starts off as friends, ends up heartbroken and friendzoned.10/10 would get heartbroken again.\n",
      "its so fun when you play with friends and do dungeons its also fun playing by yourself because the missions keep you busy i give this game 10/10\n",
      "Fun game little game to play with friends. worth a buy\n",
      "This game is amazing! It includes really good graphics and is a wonderful FPS. Highly recommended! Also, it's GREAT with friends!\n",
      "Congratulations if you bought this game. Good luck getting immersed into the beautiful world of Skyrim, explore and kill dragons! Make friends and eat and drink the greatest booze ingame. Once you got tired of exploring, get the Hearthfire DLC and build a big house get married and settle down. Then get the Dawnguard DLC to become a superduper effin epic Vampire Lord and start sucking blood. Once you're done being a Vampire get the Dragonborn DLC and get to ride a Freaking Dragon! After you done everything (you most probably won't) go to nexusmods and install new mods and you will forget you are tired of the game. You will realize that Skyrim is the real world and everything else around you is the world of Matrix.\n",
      "The game is fantastic, but of course there is a lot of bugs, some of the bugs are funny some are just weird at times.The story of the game is well use your imagination, you can build anything you want but of course you need to collect the materials you need for the job.But yes the game is fantastic, fun to play with friends so don't miss the adventure from the game!I would give this game 10/10most imortant thing is that, if the steam servers is running slow you can't really use your placed objects because they would do nothing.I would say that if there is possible to upgrade the server's connection i think it would run smooth there is some lag issues but it's not very easy to fix them. So my last thing is yes i would recommend this game to anyone who likes build houses or castle.\n",
      "This game................. i dont think a video game has ever made me cry............................ but this one DID q_q R.I.P Chloe. my heart broke when i mad max go back and let her friend die. i was depressed for days\n",
      "This game is really fun to play with a group of friends. It's not meant to have depth, it's simple. With one sitting of the game tones of unique scenarios will unfold.It really needs an online multiplayer, I would play it much more then.\n",
      "Planet side 2 is a great mmofps game it is really great is you squad up with friends or with random people its good fun to play.\n",
      "It's fun on the bun!!! Absolutely recommended to play with your friends (or enemies you decide)!\n",
      "Very fun game to play, especially with friends. Easy game to get started. I bought this on steam sale, but this is worth the normal price too. Absolutely recommend!\n",
      "Multiplayer Review Only:you looking for a fun multiplayer game with friends this is for you. First things first the topic of \"Hackers\" do they ruin multiplayer honestly some can be annoying but hey guess wat rockstar invented the \"find new session\" button for a reason right? yea they did and on top of that some \"hackers\" are really friendly and wish to help you instead of you paying for ingame currency is that wrong well yea it is not sugar coating it here it is wrong. But it can be a really fun experience being teleported around to fun jumping locations on a super pimped car. So do hackers ruin the experience depends if they like you or hate you and to be honest the player who hate you in game with give you a harder time than any hacker. Now the leveling system its average if i'm honest complete hiests and get away from the cops the usual GTA feel in the multiplayer might feel a bit repetitive but rockstar has put and continues to put fun and interesting side mission which are completely optional just like everything in the multiplayer, it is completely optional. Now with the interesting thing about the new Criminals and Excucatives is a fresh spin where \"player based\" organised events take place in free mode in the multiplayer making free mode even more chaotic fun !!! and plus you get paid for it too. :)I know this isn't a complete review but hopefully this shorten version of it will help you decide. BTW if this is on sale it is a steal and do not hesitate to buy.\n",
      "Great game and heaps fun with friends. Get it worth $30\n",
      "Counter - Strike : Global - Offensive, where do i start?First of all:The maps look pretty nice!The gameplay seems pretty realistic!I recommend this game, because of the play style and the amount of fun you can have with friends.You can play a Casual game, where you can pracise your every move.Or you could go on a community server and fool around.Or if you have more competitive tastes you can play competitive games against other people.What ever it is you do, if you want a legit game with actual aiming and strategic gameplay and that you want a fully fleshed out game, then this is the game for you.A must get, action packed game.P.S Played a game with all Russians on my teamWon 16-0Best game evar\n",
      "Hi Gamer'sRemember this is an EA title: This is a good little game given a two(2) man development team. Visuals are excellent and doe's immerse the player in an underwater environment well, the audio futher cements the experiance. The current maps are a fair size for this type of deathmatch shooter. Game mechanics seem strong, and the shooting (especially player vs player) is great fun, at times frustrating to land that killer blow. The maps are set out so that you need to collect O2, weapons, and other useful items. This allows for nice little ambush's to occur. The shark mode is interesting and fun to play as well. Good fun to play with a few friend's in Deathmatch and in the co-op mode. All in all a well done game, only lacking in player base thus far. And so far the developers have been genuinely interested in player feedback, and are open to it so as to further drive the vision they have for it. So what have you got to lose give it a go.Aris\n",
      "Hi GamersI play this simply for the co-op, and its is great fun. Scratches the itch for a solid tactical shooter, but remains barebones enough and is good for a casual bash with friends or others online. Well worth the purchase just if you are interested in the co-op, as more content has been released and it has a good amount of mods also.Game on!Aris\n",
      "Beta reviewSummary: 8/10Review:Awesomely fun game with a good twist on the mmo design.This game with its 120 classes and 21 professions is a joy to play with strangers and friends alike however at the point of this review the game feels a litttle pay to win with you being able to pay gems and getting higher tier mounts and gliders at the start of the game. The labour points is a necessary evil as it stops the economy from being flooded by useless items at launch as so many games have. Its graphics are quite good but are bound to get better as it goes into open stateThe classes are fun and chaotic. Many build have no chance of working while some require a little tweaking to work. They all feel quite solid on their own and allow fun strategys between friends. Last mention:Wait till release when its f2p at the end of the year\n",

      "Interestingly, I think this is a very effective Rorschach test of a game. Gender is unasigned, and the story allows for a fair amount of interpetation, so I played as a closeted lesbian best friend who didn't make a move on her (presumed straight) friend in high school, then went to engineering school, then got drunk and hooked up with her old best friend, ruining that friendship and another budding romance. The ending was especially poignant in this scenario, and unlike the \"beta/friendzone\" experience others felt, it felt heartbreaking for both characters, rather than being one sided.Great little indy title, that really shows the strength of gaming as an artistic medium through it's ability to involve and allow choices in narrative, even when there are relatively few moving pieces.\n",

      "Great game, wide variety of weapons, items, armour and enemies. I highly recomend this game. You can build, fight, collect, build and fight and do WHATEVER you want. Your first step in this game is to beat the Wall of Flesh and get into hardmode. Some might say that's the end, but it is only the start. MORE BOSSES, MORE WEAPONS, MORE ARMOUR, MORE ENEMENE... ENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEMEN... ENEMENEMENEM... ENEMENEMENEMEN... you get the point right? JUST MORE OF EVERYTHING!!!!6/10 Needs more explosions. Joke. It is a decent game to play with friends or while bored.\n",
      "This is a truly AMAZING game! You pilot your Kerbals into space with the spaceship YOU made!The main objective to the game is to successfully pilot your Kerbals into the Mun (Moon} and eventually any planet. This game does take some getting used to. It took me personally a couple hours with my friend on voice chat trying to explain to me how to do everything (TBH: I still am trying to get the hang of it), BUT after you figure out how to play, then it is INCREDIBLY FUN to play.WARNING: It is very normal to have your first HUNDRED attempts to fail and it takes EVEN LONGER to get to the Mun with proper landing and everything.7/10 It needs to have better tutorials explaining what to actually do.Played it since before steam and it has developed AWESOMELY!\n",
      "i find this game a little boring to play without friends simply because so much time in it is spent hack away at the ground and watching a loading bar. The exploring is fun though and the honest to god only complaint i have is that doing things like digging tunnels and flattening land just takes to long. Other than the stated problem  i do like this game, i just hope they make doing things a little quicker. dont really wanna be watching a loading bar for 3 hours just so i can make a copper axe\n",
      "this game = fantastic if you dont have it your doing yourself a favor by  buying this game.play it with friends it increases the fun factor by 10000000 so when you have finished reading my thought on this game goooooo buy it right......DO IT geeez...\n",

      "Ok, ive reviewed it before, but i feel like i should review it based on a perspective of a Marvel fanboy & an avid gamer:The game is really fun to play, especially when you play this game with friends, yes, you either need to pay or work your way to a new hero, but games like these expect you to work hard for rewards, and working is better than just buying your way to victory, graphics are ok for me on my laptop, I like the fact that their adding more & more heroes as the game grows, I also like the fact that their adding more & more to the story of the game, making the game much more hyped for new players, you got heroes voiced by some of the most talented voice actors ever, like Deadpool, voiced by the great Nolan North, the gameplay itself is enhancing, you get to experience different movesets per hero & get to really play your hero more in order to perfectly master their moves, with PVP soon to be out of beta, the in-game dialogue and the fact that heroes can actually have conversations with each other is down right awesome, more heroes, great story, hard work, just wat you can expect from MMORPG'sAnd also, I also saw a review that a person does not recommend the game because he wants the game to be optimized to Xbox controllers, try playing DOTA 2 with an Xbox controller, then update your reviewOverall, yeah, get the game, it may be high in memory, their may be big updates, but throughout all that, its all gonna be worth itScore for Marvel fans/avid MMORPG gamers: 9.5/10Score for non-Marvel people: 7.3/10\n",

Day Z has super ♥♥♥♥ed up zombies and this game has an easier way to acquire weapons, making it a more PvP based survival.To finish, great game and i recommend getting it if you have friends to play with, and don't get too attached to your loots ;)\n",
      "Great game to play with friends. Medium replay value with the option to replay the game @ higher levels. Great amount of guns and loot to fight over. Most of my hours are on ps3 #IaintNoScrub\n",
      "\"EW TERRERIA SUKZ K\"\"TERRERIA? THATS THE WRST GAEM EVR\"\"MC IS BETTER\"People who say that ♥♥♥♥ that they never even TOUCHED/PLAYED that game needs to get some help. They have NO FRIKIN IDEA how much fun this game is! You have ur little 2D world with ur customized character and BAM! Get started and do a thing.And its even better when you play with friends too!+Great building materials +Can customize a character+A good survival system+Epic weapons and armor+Really smooth ores that you can mine+Underground terrain is HUGE+Very well detailed dungeons +Really amazing bosses to defeat+Nice buffs+Multiplayer system makes the game even more fun+Difficulty options you can choose from (Eg: Hardmode, Softcore)+Still have items on character when you join or create another world+Can customize ur mouse cursor to variety colors +EverythingYou really need to get into this if you've never played this game before!\n",
      "My friend was afk at the start of the match so i killed all of the teammates 420/10 would kill again\n",
      "Awesome and addciting game, really fun when u have one or two of your friends play with you. The mechanics are sort of similair to that of team fortress 2 with the rocket jumps. The only downside is theres not enough maps to play on and overtime the maps get boring. Otherwise, great game!!\n",
      "Great game, fun with friends but also fun while your playing by yourself. The community is good and you can see your feet! I would give this game 11/10 You have to put hours in to be good at the game and unlock things (I guess you could say its a bit of a grind)but its so rewarding when you get the good weapons. Its also easy to get XP by doing the right things in the game. The graphics arn't the greatest but still you are still able to deal with them.\n",
      "Most definitely one of my favorite games on steam. Ronimo has made an excellent side scrolling MOBA with awesomenauts, the variety of characters and upgrade system make this game tons of fun, it's even better with a friend or two. If you have 10 bucks and you're not sure what to buy, this should definitely be at the top of your list. One last thing, this game has an AMAZING soundtrack, so many memorable songs for each naut, and don't even get me started on the theme song, woowee that get's stuck in your head quickly. But srs, 9.5/10\n",
      "This Game is aimed at kids obviously, has a mario or one of those old ps1 games styles to it, i wouldn't recommend it but it's an okay game!Pros Soundtrack is pretty cool Get to collect the tears of fairies and berriesGet to smash the crap out of people trying to hurt you or innnocent caterpillarsCons Terrible handling of  controls Graphics are worse than Half LifeStoryline is none exsistant and is just plain crapThe animals 1 hit you then you restart, no checkpoints for each level which is absolute annoying and bs Overall The game is just dumb and should not even be on steam. Oh Even though a friend gave this to me for free i would not play it again \n",
      "Education about guns taking apart guns and assembling them again. Great game for people who are big into guns, so therefore I rate this game...... 7/10 recommend this to my friends and random people\n",
      "This game is... Strange...(I'm not the best reviewer, so bear with me here.)Let me rephrase, it's a good strange. In my opinion, the first 1-4 episodes were absolutely brilliant, nothing short of a masterpiece. At the very last episode, similar to The Walking Dead (Season 1), you are picked to chose between two endings. However, both of these endings have outcomes that are virtually the exact opposite of each other. Everyone else has explained episodes 1-4 in detail very well, however, Ill shine some light on 5. If you have ever had to say goodbye to an amazing friend. Or maybe even have one perish, this game will speak to you. Every person who has done that, or experienced that, will connect to the main character with flying colours. And depending how sensitive you are, or if you are recalling a best friend's funeral, you will shead some tears with the main character at the end.If not, don't get me wrong, you will still love this game. All of the ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ that happens, all of the characters with distinct personalities, it loops around into one final goodbye. One last breath.Alright I lied I will talk about the rest of the game.. This is a game that talks about life... Alright sure, it has time travel in it, but, the game gives you an exact representation of real life. Every thing she goes through, (FINE.. fine.. Not the damn dark room) you will too. Theft, debt, phases, love, a test of friendship, parenthood, life lessons, death... No rather, a dying's wish. One can look at this game, and learn. Learn things some people have gone through hell and back to find. Please play this game..\n",
      "This game is... Good. Well, that's an understatement. It's very good. A survival type game where you do all you can to stay alive. Not just from the dinosaurs, but from the other people with killer intentions. The only game that comes close to this is Rust. Pros:1. Dinosaur Haven! Have you ever wanted to tame a dinosaur as a pet? Or even ride it? This game has those mechanics, and its amazing. 2. Unrealism. Now, don't take that the wrong way. No one wants a game that's two realistic. And if they do, or claim to, they're either ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting or they're stupid. This game has, starting off atleast, a minecraft field to it. Punch trees, and build tools... Ang guns.3. Absolutely amazing with friends. This game is one of the best games to play co-op with. It doesn't matter who its with. Maybe its someone you met on the server, or a 10 year friendship with your bff. This game will get you hooked!4. Amazing Scenery. Even in alpha, this game looks just as good, if not better, than Witcher 3. Nuff said.5. HUGE WORLD! This world is absolutely stunning, looks and size (Thats what she said).Cons.1. Difficult for beginners. This game, atleast for me, has one of the hardest learning curves I've experienced. From the multiple blood thirsty players to the dilo's that spawn on your face every few seconds (Not literally. They're just EVERYWHERE) beginners will not survive very long without some direction.2. Easy to get out of without friends. This game is a game meant for coop, and without it, this game is quite hard to keep interest. 3. Mac players will DIE. Now I don't have a mac, but my friends that do cannot play this game, or so they claim. Conclusion: If you have the computer to play, and the friends to play with, this game is a must own. Even though the game is in alpha, it feels like its development stages are way past some of the games being released today.\n",
      "To those who are reading this review, there are a few things you must note. One thing is that I almost always play with other people while playing any version of the Borderlands series, and Borderlands 2 is one of my favourate games of all time, so I will compare it to Borderlands 2 in a lot of ways.Borderlands Pre-Sequal, which will now be refered to BPS for efforts sake, has a lot of potential to be something better than what it is now. For a brief summary of the game, its basically a DLC for Borderlands 2, and probably would have been better if it was. The good things about BPS is that the new characters are amazing. I won't deny that. I absolutely love the idea of playing as claptrap, or using aimbot to destroy everything in your way as Nisha. However, the game seems watered down. I played through the game with minimal grinding, and only using guns I find off the floor from random loot drops. I, personally, played the game as both Athena and Nisha, and both didn't take much effort to get through the game. Playing with friends in BPS isn't as good as it was. In Borderlands 2, I was always at the edge of my seat trying to snipe the goliath's, or sneaking up on other enemies. But this game seems more like a casual game. With another player, there is little to no challenge at all, and feels like you have to, literally, drag youself through the game. With Nisha and Athena playing together, you can get through the game in a few hours.Overall, if you need something to play, or if you're really bored, consider buying this game. However, its way to much for what you get from the game.\n",
      "Very good puzzles, very short, but very cheap.Just as I thought it was getting hard, it finished, which is a shame, but it was $0.99 and in retrospect I'd happily have paid $2 for it.I have made friends buy it and they loved it too.\n",
      "The combination of an emotional backstory, exquisite soundtrack and the most user-friendly and logical difficulty scale, as well as undeniably beautiful graphics makes Bastion the most beautifully crafted and engaging game that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.Five stars.96/100.I never want it to end.\n",
      "A pointless DayZ mod story:I played this game endlessly for over a year, playing vanilla DayZ mod from mid-late 2013 to early 2014 when I moved to DayZ Epoch. On the quiet Epoch server, the next few months were a blast as I became a loyal member and moderator of the Redline Gamers community until it died down over late 2014.After all this I can tell you my time playing DayZ has been the most entertaining, often exhilarating, sometimes calming and unforgettable experiences I've had ever.There is nothing more stressing than going to loot a military base  in fear of a far ghillied sniper. Nothing more angering than your pilotting friend crashing your precious helicopter into a mountain because he was \"looking at the map\". Nothing more enjoyable than the memes, jokes, good times and friends I've made being part of a community here.Ive talked to many different people, made friends and heard stories. Witnessed many acts of great kindness and many acts of pure evil. And witnessed some of the most unreal situations and events that only this game, in all it's realism and conplexity, could create.Whether you are genuinely trying to survive in the attempted realism of DayZ mod or gearing up a base with your friends to murder every other player in DayZ Epoch, this game is the right stuff. Two years on I still remember some of the things that happened in this game and people I've met. Arma and its mods are titled as realistic simulators, and the memories of this game I have are VERY real\n",
      "Guns of Icarus is a very fun game to play. You can play with your friends and make a team, customize characters and ships, and all other cool stuff\n",
      "This game is awesome , you go through an intense campaign with other players or friends , you try to stay alive till the end or you can be a zombie and try to infect the survivors ,it has lots of missions and there will always be fun .\n",
      "A game itself that requires teamwork, communication and skill. I had some games which people are friendly, even though we are from opposing teams. Most games I've ever played had people talking crap about other people's ethnic, cultures and race. I will never understand why people blame others for loosing just because they're from Russia, Phillipines, South America (especially people in South East Asia, I'm looking at you). We're all just people sitting in front of a computer playing the same game. Yes, for the first few games we may be bad at it, but with each game, we learn from our mistakes , we take advices from our fellow teamates and become better. Guys, if we could be a little more polite, we could make the Dota community a better place and a better game for everyone to play instead of being immature by calling names or sh**talking others.\n",
      "Spawned Walked for 1 f*cking long hour to find a friend, turns out I was in a different town.DayZ is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ comunitty, I payd 26 Euros for an early acces ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game wich zambies get trough walls I think in 2100 Dayz will get out of the early acess.\n",
      "fun little space strategy game, well worth the price.has three different campains each will take about 45 mins-1 hour to complete.also has skirmish mode. which is fun and challenging.can upgrade your different ships and weaponary.can vs your friends in multiplayer and can also vs randoms in multiplayer public matches.\n",
      "Quite fun although a massive grind which can get very boring after a while. Fun to play with friends!\n",
      "this game is Amazing and i recomend it to all of my friends and anyone else who likes FPS games\n",
      "A game that is bland and boring to play by yourself, but when you bring friends into the equation, it becomes a masterpiece full of hours of gameplay and many laughs. You wont be able to put this game down untill you have completed all 3 difficulties that you unlock by completing the previous. only real downside is the huge amount of dlc that will seem to rob you from all your money. 9/10 hyped for the next borderlands game\n",
      "(9/10)Really enjoyable platformer game with my favorite voice actor, voicing the main character! It also has a great sound track. Unfortunatly no one seems plays online multiplayer so unless you have friends with this game, you cant play some of it.\n",
      "This game is rather unique.It is brutal and it is scary at times.If you have ever thought that you'd be a survivour in the Z apocalypse? Play this game and see how long you will live. This game tests you and at points it comes down to luck. If you like survival games or Z apocalypse games? Play this game, get it, support it, love it. The only negative I have for this game is the lack of possible Co-op multiplayer. It is really difficult to set this up and there are limited AU servers as well, making it difficult to play with friends currently. Buy this game, and support it.\n",
      "Great way to kill time with friends\n",
      "Don't Starve is an incredible game. The graphics are a unique and endearing style, the controls nicely set out and the challenge of the game all combine to make it what it is. Probably one of my favourite parts about this game, discluding the graphics (which I love), is having only one life. You die, it's game over, unless you have stumbled upon a rare touch-stone, granting you an extra life. You have to be ready and think ahead to avoid losing everything, and when you get to low health, it's time to go into panic mode. There are so many dangers, keeping an eye on your hunger, picking flowers to avoid going insane, having enough light to last through the night and all the monsters found in this game make it an amazing experience. The crafting aspect of the game is also very nicely done, collecting the resources and building the machines you need to advance further into the game. The only downfall is the inability to multi this game and share this experience with your friends. It would be amazing to be able to play Don't Starve with your friends, competing against or looking after each other, but sadly it is not able to be done. All in all, this game is an unforgettable experience that I will keep coming back to time and time again, to try and get further than I did last time and to see what I missed out on because I hadn't made it that far yet.9/10\n",
      "great game to play with friends just hope he fixes the bug with mac users were you can join servers :P but still its a great game and i cant wait for the next update :D\n",
      "Ups: -Terrain destruction is amazing-Infestation Mode is intense and can get challenging -Variety of weapons (however some of them feel useless compared to others)-Aliens are generally fun to fight-Some of the guns are freaking hilarious to kill aliens with (Magnet gun anyone?)-In the few short missions that you use a vehicle, you feel unstoppable and badass.Downside:-Quite Short gameplay time, no openworld exploration (apart from free mode, which is just a tiny map)-Can be repetitive in some areas, especially when the same aliens keep popping up.-Game crashed once or twice when I pressed a button in game.-Can feel like it's all going way too fast (might not be a bad thing in your case)Conclusion: I've only ever played Armageddon and Guerilla from the Red Faction series. I found Guerilla to give me more entertainment since it was open world and the destruction you caused wasn't limited to a level. However, Armageddon still gave me a solid 8-10 hours gameplay offline, which only included the campaign, a few infestation levels and about an hour mucking about in free roam. I have not tried Online and there are plenty more things to do in offline mode (achievements, secrets, harder difficulties, etc.) Graphics wise the game was OK. I was playing the game off a new-ish laptop and everything ran fine, however I don't think graphics are on par with games that came out around the same time. But hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?I definitely recommend this game to any one looking for intense FPS destruction game. I payed $5 when it was on sale, however I think the original price of $20 is worth it, especially if you can get some friends in on it. Rating: 7/10\n",
      "This game is very great but one thing is i cant join a online, while they are still working on it u can join with your friend all u need is Hamachi then u go to host then make a match then when it done hosting if u dont know how to give the ip go to your Hamachi abovie ( sorry for bad spelling) your name then coppy that and share it with your friend how easy is that. PPL dont just need Hamachi only when they want to host. THX U\n",

      "This game is very cool and fun ist very hard the rank up but the cool ting is that you can upgrade your weponse and blade and they can lvl up too. The warframe look very cool ASWOME spower and you can play vs its very hard to join in a vs mode. Anywy you can add me as friend: KILLER1942. see you soon XD\n",
      "Apparently is free to play... and yet is is being shared from a friend...\n",
      "Have really enjoyed this game, through the bad times and good times. Playing with friends and laughing about the kills and deaths is what it is about. The Dec's for this game are truly remarkable, really active on \"Reddit\" and really do listen to peoples opinions. First two weeks of released the people have asked for \"oceanic\" and \"eu\" servers and we got the eu servers within a week and oce severs a week after. The combat is fun but can be stressful at times, guns are really strong but take alot of time and energy to obtain. Even if you do obtain a gun theres only a few rounds in it. The cosmatics are all given to you for free for playing a round and depending how well you do or don't is how rare your loot is. The Dev's also have a website where you can put in your votes as too what is important and what needs to be added into the game asap. Overall i'll say if you like battle royal games and love having a laugh with a friend while they get brutally beaten with a stick, this game is for you!Edit:I recommended this game when it first released but unfortunately i cannot recommand it anymore, with every patch comes a new problem and it has drove away many players. Theres a delay even though i'm playing on the oce server (live in nz), takes forever to find a game now. I understand the dev's are trying to make the game better but they seriously need to get the game to a stable state before releasing more content.TLDR: game worked before now it's laggy and it takes forever to find a game.\n",
      "Starbound is a great game lots of fun.Even better with friends.\n",
      "If you dont have friends the FFA mode is not worth it with many people deciding to team up (most ive seen was a team of 5) so it's almost impossible to win the \"FFA\".However if you have a friend to play with then it is well worth your money and time.\n",
      "Really fun game!Really good to play with friends(if you have any)JK\n",
      "Best game ever, beating up enemies but mostly beating up ur friends, i would recommend it 10/10\n",
      "Highly recommended if you love JRPGS and stupid corny animay jokes. I learnt how to nep a nep, how to search dungeons for hours looking for new dungeon plans and how to grind on polytans to get everyone to max level. Most importantly I dissapointed my friends and family even further.Ps- Blanc best girl\n",
      "After dying a lot, i finally got set up with a friend with a shotgun and a stable locked up house. It was very fun after that. We were right beside a pack of Mutant Bears and Wolves. We killed them everytime they respawned. We got all our stuff from my friends house (inside a rock, btw... glitches.....) Anyway, it was very fun, still haven't seen a zombie though.\n",
      "No subtlety at all.Doesn't even pretend to be subtle.The narrator spends the game stating the obvious and just broke any sense of immersion and he may as well have been a friend telling me about that guy he knows. He needed to do more helping you through the game, less explaining the obvious interpretation. Especially given the ending. It would've been more impacting if you had made the same assumptions that the narrator had made independently of him telling them to you. Because then you could've felt like you were in the narrator's shoes.I saw the trailer and thought \"oh, so I get to do some discovery about who this guy is. Sweet.\"I got \"Oh, so I get to listen to someone telling me who this guy is for 90 minutes.\"\n",
      "I've honestly tried my hardest to like this game but at every turn I've had such a poor experience, the gameplay itself is top notch, it's easily the best MK game of them all! The issue is with the streaming content method via steam, I bought the Kollectors Edition which is great I was so pleased to open the box, I found a slightly scuffed game case but that wasn't a big deal because I had a nice Scorpion model, this is when I found out none of the game was even on the DVD, it was simply a barebones Steam installer.Okay so that was no worries, I downloaded what I could of the game at a friends place and got started, no worries. Then came the updates, I downloaded those on my phone internet at home (cant get adsl) and could play now all of a sudden its telling me none of my DLC isnt installed. I swear I have downloaded 20gb of content for this game and its telling me I only have 4gb. I have no idea whats going on but I'm not happy with how this game is being supported. I just want to enjoy it but all these issues outside of the game experience has got me to the point I just want to remove it and play something thats not so much hassle.\n",
      "Alright, first of all? First of all;I've been a huge supporter of Undertale since it's Kickstarter campaign in 2013. But I didn't entirely know what to expect from the game's full release. To be honest, I was nervous as to whether it would be as good as the 40 minute Beta.And after beating the game? I'm at a loss for words.This game has almost all the aspects of a lot of other games that I truly admired for years before even knowing about Undertale. But Undertale? It gets those features that made games like Cave Story and MOTHER 3 and ramps it up to a solid 11.It's clear that Toby Fox, and his other colleagues behind the creation of Undertale, put years of dedication, passion and love into this GameMaker Studio™ title, and for what it is, it exceeds all expectations. But that's enough about the game in general, allow me to discuss the key elements of the game that will make it worth your time.Let's start with the gameplay itself, as that IS the central core of the game.The gameplay is very similar to that of the MOTHER/EarthBound series. In which you control a child, which you then promptly name. This child then stumbles into a vast labyrinth deep under a mountain known as \"The Underground\", and it's your task to escape said caverns. The Underground is full of what are known as \"Monsters.\" a race of often anthropomorphic creatures, with some exceptions. As you make your way through the caverns, you begin to face monsters in combat, wherein you can choose to slaughter them or persuade them to see you as friendly and to leave you alone. Each option equally difficult to execute. Also, in combat, you dodge enemy attacks by moving your character's \"soul\" out of the way of their projectiles, which adds in a fun, bullet-hell spin on what would otherwise be a generic turn-based RPG fighting system.Secondly; the art. The artstyle is, for what it is, consistant to the nature of the game itself, while still managing to display colour and variety. For instance, you could be talking to a beautifully sprited, handsome skeleton man one minute, but then in the next room, you're caught face to face with a mishmash of shapes, colours and voices, beckoning you to sit down and share a glass of water with them. On a note of the art present in Undertale, the battle scenes, while purely in black and white, rarely sporting coloured, geometric backgrounds are beautifully animated, making it seem like the characters themselves aren't just static sprites, but actually friends and foes, challenging you to a match of wits and strength. However, while a lot of the overworld sprites (characters/objects you encounter when not in combat) don't have shading, it still suits the beautifully crafted room textures and landscapes. Overall? The art in the game is far above average, and is both beautiful and emanates a sense of purpose into each room.Also? Music.Toby Fox is quite the renowned musician when it comes to quality Video Game Music, which adds another entire layer of perfection to this game. Each song is written to convey a message, or a story, or to give life to the already lustrous scenery and battles. I myself, was already a huge fan of Toby's work in the hit webcomic \"Homestuck.\" so I knew from the start that this game's soundtrack would be an absolute treat to listen to. I promptly bought the soundtrack as I bought the game itself on Steam. And might I say? It was a wise investment. The soundtrack of Undertale has over 100 individual songs, each one a blissful tune, which I believe may become well-known classics in VGM history.Now, let's get down to business. Let's discuss my favourite part of the game.The characters.Good grief, I have never played a video game with such nuanced, charming and overall relatable characters in my life. Each character is blessed with dreams, goals, ideals and individual quirks which shape and mold their personalities into unique, fun and heart-warming characters.*Cough cough* Mom, I mean- Toriel.. Or even thoroughly despicable, loathsome characters. *Cough cough* Which may end up being some of your FAVOURITE characters.The story? I'm gonna keep it quick for you.Undertale has, in my oppinion, one of, if not THE most engaging and satisfying stories I've ever seen in any video game. Laughter, sadness, hatred, remorse, empathy and cruelness are all emotions that I had felt while playing, and feeling like a part of the story, not just watching some child and their endeavors. I find this is because the characters interact WITH you, as opposed to just sitting there, watching the characters sort out the situation like a third wheel. It's a genuinely, intreaguing experience.So there you have it. What do I think of Undertale?I think it's the most marvelous video game I've ever had the honour to play.10/10. An A+ effort by Toby Fox and the team behind it's creation.Aheh... S-Sorry about everything, Flowey...\n",

      "A fun, team deathmatch game with a very bright and friendly community, would recommend for people ages 10+\n",
      "Simply not interesting enough for me to keep playing, I haven't played it since it came out, and my friend's situations were similar. Not sure about the game quality, but from other users I can see that people think its not as good as 3 or NV. Not judging the game quality, but if a game isn't interesting enough for me to keep playing it, thats saying something\n",

      "Great game, hours of fun with friends. Also good for learning new languages!\n",
      "This game is just awesome, massive fun to have here with friends, a clan or just yourself. Each faction; Vanu, New Conglomerete and Terren have a balacned feel to each weapon and vehicle. But the main fun to have here is the Air and Land battle fought between the factions, in a normal battle for a base you would see dozens of other players battle it out with very little air and a ton of tanks, but when battling with or against a clan, you would see a minumum amount of tanks, but a sky full of troop transports with other player dropping down to try and claim the base.Tons of fun to be had in this game.8/10\n",
      "This game is a great game, but in it's current form -- it's bad, worse than previous updates.Day Z is one of the greatest survival games out there. Even thought the game is very buggy and alot of glitches at the point of writing the review, this game is great fun to have with friends. You can choose your own adventure, kill whoever you like, team up with whoever you like or gather any gear to which you like. Day Z also creates a great sense of horror with the sound of zombies nearby (escpecially in the dark), but it wont matter if you have weapon of any sort. There is alot of fun to be had in Day Z (alpha is preety ♥♥♥♥ though).8.5/10 (Old)5/10 (New)\n",
      "I've had this game for quite some time, and every hour spent was worth it. Unlike Minecraft (and others of the sort), Terraria involves you with not so much a story line, but a kind of \"bucket list\". Defeat one boss, get loot and prepare for the next one, or just scour the world for chests and hope you get something great. You can use the endless community knowledge to help you get started or go in blind and try to prepare yourself. Great game, fun for everyone and even better when playing with friends. 10/10 - its replayable, great fun and a new adventure each time round with new loot and new experiences.\n",
      "I have only played for a short while, but with a group of friends to start off with, it has been a lot of fun. Free roaming and the situation of \"once you are dead, you really lose everything\" adds a nice aspect.

      "I remember having this on console awhile back, and I had a blast with it. There are so many things done right in this, truely a spectacular racing game. EA shut down the store, which is such a shame because that Jansen hovered at 88 mph. Multiplayer is stil great fun, although not too many people play it anymore so it's best to get a bunch of friends and have a good time. A great classic, a great buy. If you enjoy racing games and for some odd reason never played this, I would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Ruined my social life. I now have no friends 10/10\n",
      "Robbing banks has never been so fun.Some heists are down right impossible to solo, at least until you are a much higher level, but the AI can thankfully soak up a tonne of bullets before going down, even if they are near incompetant otherwise.Playing with friends is where this game really shines. Co-ordinating a heist down to the second, then having it all blow up in a moment when a stray guard spots you, while frustrating, can make for fun times.\n",
      "Looks great, lots of fun in co-op and many different heists and ways to performs heists. This game will keep you busy for a long time, especially if you have friends who have it.Highely reccomend it.\n",
      "I'm really over people complaining they have either been scammed or that they have wasted their money in purchasing this. The store gives plenty of warning and even Rocket himself has his own reccomendation into purchasing the Early-access Alphahttp://forums.dayzgame.com/index.php?/topic/155089-is-it-worth-buying-dayz-standalone-yet-rocket-response/ Not to mention buy making this purchase you will not have to pay anymore for this game you will have it for life and all the updates included which will pick up after Christmas/New Years, plus the price will increase later down the devlopment path (that will be awhile away however).Personally, I think that as an alpha release it worked quite smoothly, only real issues that affect me personally are the lack of zombies and respawning of loot, which are going to be fixed very soon which makes the player engagement strong in this game at the moment, I mean what else is there to do? Holding people up, force feeding them, cuffing them and shooting and breaking their legs or leaving them to bleed out or if you're not that much of an ♥♥♥♥ instead interact and help other players who knows you might even make some new friends :)Running off the Take on Helicopters engine which is pretty much between Arma 2 and Arma 3 the game looks beautiful and in my opinion performs more smoother than the mod I've read alot about people experiencing major performance issues on killer rigs but I know later they are looking into optimising and making the game run better for everyone which is understandable I play on medium to high with my 660 and i5 3570k and 8Gb ram I get around 20-30 in major cities and 50-70 in other areas of course it's not entirely stable but it's playable to say the leastOverall if you've played the Arma 2 mod you may find playing this game alot easier with past experience and might be a bit of a struggle for new players, despite that there is plenty of tutorials online and probably through the discussion in the steam community if you're willing to dig through a bunch of cry babies and their ignorant comments but yeah if you have some friends who have this I guarantee you will have a great safer and probably more confident in moving around and doing thingsWith the open world there's plenty to explore until the lack of content is improved - but hey it's alpha for gods sake :PI reccomend 10/10\n",

      "Unturned to put it simple is an overload of multi player gold, with simple mindcraft inspired graphics, this Zombies survival sandbox is not only fun too play by yourself but even better with a group of friends. From cutting wood and mining stones to make a base for yourself, to exploring the nearby zombie infested towns and military bases to scavenge for the essentials to surive, this game has everything you would expect in a zombie survival game from the game mechanics (Having the need to constistently look for fresh food, water and keep yourself non-infected) to the ombience of the game it makes it a very enjoyable game too play.\n",

      "I spent a fair amount of time playing this game. I ENJOYED PLAYING THIS GAME! IT IS A FUN EXPERIENCEThe MOBA - FPS gameplay is fun! The character designs are awesome. The humor in the game is what you'd expect from Borderlands, not that its a bad thing. Playing with friends is, of course, a far better experience, but regardless, its still fun to play with strangers.Unfortunately, the way things are going for Battleborn, I can't recommend it. On the first few weeks of playing, there were already issues with connectivity. Oceania players have been having troubles with connecting to a game, with wait times lasting as long as 15 - 20 minutes, and when they do get put into a game, the match ends up being very unbalanced with players being teamed up with others that are either complete beginners or long playing veterans. There have also been issues regarding performance. Certain levels in the game can even strain the highest performing gaming rigs. This results in players choosing certain levels in PVP. If this isn't an issue for you then fine, but playing on the same levels time and time again for the sake of keeping a solid frame rate can get a bit tedious. Can't enjoy a nice juicy steak if that's all you're ever gonna eat. Sometimes you want a cheeseburger... or something. Whatever, bad example. I'm sure that theese issues will be solved in future patches. With the game going for 40% off after only being out for 3 WEEKS, I'd say buy it, but at full price, it just isn't worth it. If you are thinking about buying this game, buy it during a sale. Otherwise, set aside Battleborn and buy O-...ther games that are well worth their full price.\n",
      "Okay first things first. This game is still in the works. Still being improved on. Despite that, this game is still very addictive to play. Sure there are only a few bugs but no noticable enough to ruin your gameplay. The game is even better with friends in multiplayer. Make a competition to see who can survive the longest and who gets to be zombie food first. Would totally recommend buying this. Again, this is an early access game still in development, but that means that it can only get better from here.\n",
      "my first favorite game because im addict to 20th century warplanes i watch a lot of documentery on 20th century warplanes,as far as i own this is the very best simulator game for tanks and warplane and gaijin would put down the warships next so i wish my friends to play this game =D\n",

      "At first glance, Terraria seems to be a lackluster indie game with a clunky, confusing interface and a list of crafting options a mile wide. Especially for you Minecraft transplants, you’ll initially find the flat, side-scrolling perspective a bit off-putting after countless hours having been spent in an immersive, 3D environment. Take some time to adjust your lenses, however, and you’ll discover a game that’s both deep and almost endlessly entertaining.In Terraria, you are plopped into a randomly generated world, your only task is to explore, survive and thrive. Survival isn’t even top of your “to-do list”, as the minor penalty of losing coins upon death is nothing more than a momentary set-back for the most part. The real driving force behind Terraria is its amorous advances of exploration, drawing you in with suggestive displays of pots and vases in surface-level caves, before luring you deeper with promises of heaving chests and rich ores.There is a wealth of fun to be had with this game, but accessing it can be an insufferable challenge to start out. Without any solid tutorials in-game, your left to wander the world, clueless as to what to do. The guide, a starting NPC, can give you useful tips here-and-there, but without any discernible goal to achieve, it’s hard to see the appeal at first. Building a shelter is a confusing chore, crafting weapons; an alien concept, and survival at night is a daunting task. Plus, once you’ve mastered single player, you can take your character online, to tackle all the challenges the world has to offer with a few friends; or simply start from scratch and carve a new adventure (boss battles are certainly easier, but never-the-less challenging). For the small price to buy into this title, you’ll get more than your moneys worth in gameplay. (Available to buy through Steam)Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some Hellstone armour to craft, a Demon Alter to find and an Eater of Worlds to slay.Score: By yourself: 5/10With friends: 8.5/10\n",

      "Great game , along with great characters and abilities , i like the game modes , its fun playing it with your friends , and you can even customize characters , it is really a good game for a MOBA player\n",
      "This here is a game that looks extremely positive and looks like it can turn out to be a fantastic game on release. However, right now performance for this game is quite bad as I can run GTA online, full of people on mixed settings and get absolutely no lag at all but for this game I have everything in the settings set on low and I am constantly lagging and rubberbanding (This is me playing on a server with just one friend btw). Until they update the game and improve the performance I would avoid this game.\n",
      "I remember growing up with the original game and that wasn't too long ago but when I finally saw this on steam I realised that now I don't need to use my friends copy of the game to install it. I can just pay for a game that is well worth the money with all these new features and never have to worry about asking my friend for his copy. I personally think everyone should pick up this game but thats just me. It can provide a great challenge when you need/ want it and if thats not good enough for you, there is editor/sandbox mode which is pretty self explanitory. They have done a great job of recreating Age of Mythology.\n",
      "This isn't your average fighting game.Toribash is about pulling off awesome moves to defeat manequin-like people, if it was that easy. It is extremely complicated and takes a while to get used to. So unless you are willing to invest a large amount of your time in this I would leave it alone.Starting to play this game I would start clicking on random body parts trying to kick the other guy in the face and eventually fall over onto the floor and flop around trying to get back up until I get disqualified because something other than my limbs brushed the floor like I was playing 'the floor is lava'. After I got the hang of it (to a degree) I started to pull of some cool moves and I did have a bit of fun with it. Even if I still kept falling over onto the floor.I also tried it out with my friends, which I have to say was a lot of fun. Most of the games ended up with us both on the floor swinging random body parts around in an attempt to hit eachother while trying not to get disqualified until it ended up like the least interesting game of twister ever. But in the end we had a good laugh.There are also a lot of mods (and I mean a lot) for this game, that can change it completely and make the game a bit more interesting. I won't go too much in detail about that though as there are too many mods to write a review on.This game is definately worth picking up especially for the fact that is free, it's definately a unique experience for the fighting genre and it equals for a good laugh with friends.8/10 :)\n",

      "Monaco is a game in which you, along with a band of other criminals go on ridiculous endeavors to go on heists, clear evidence of previous heists and so much more. It has its own simple but very unique and dynamic art style which is not quite retro but in a pixelated look; and dont get me started on the music. This is one of the best factors of this game, with a quirky piano solo in the backround which suddenly escalates as you alert security. The storyline is also exellent as you play the roles of many different characters, each with their own funny personality. As you play through the campain, the story develops and twists and creates great suspence and enjoyment. I fail to get bored of this game with the huge amounts of extra campains adding to the backstory and the almost infinite amount of crazy workshop created levels which you can play with friends. 10/10\n",
      "So. My first time playing this game.. Engaged in fistycuffs with another honorable gentleman. It was a good show but upon besting him in fistycuffs his friend shot me in the face with his bow. Good show!The next time I spawned. I found another naked man to engage in fistycuffs with. He bested me. Honorably I made my way to pleasant valley, found a gun, found him, and shot him in the head. But upon feeling so guilty for doing so, I hurdled myself off a building in the name of the sun god. I used myself as a human sacrifice. Good show!My next few spawns I was killed repeatedly with a stick. I found a stick and was still repeatedly killed. Rito pl0x nerf.I had becomed geared af and I had a machine gun and a pistol running around killing everyone in sight. I hit an arrow with my car. I exploded.10/10 would bang again\n",

L4D2 is definately a team game and it works smoothly  when joining either a friends game or a random game.  The add ons from the workshop has made it easier to get some awesome custom material. I never tire playing the campaigns, it's one of those games that you play for hours and want to come back for more.  Well done! 9/10\n",

Using the same concepts as the Super Smash Brothers series it can be a bit hard to master, but Blue Mammoth games has knocked it out of the map with this one (pun intended). with a wide range of different characters to choose from and a large variety of weapons to choose from Brawlhalla is a fun game to play with friends even through all the blood, sweat, salt and tears.My Regards Rangerada is best character pls buff and nerf thatch is too op\n",

Downside : Due to the recent update the update of the rank system have directly destroy the community. They in order to manage the rank they derank most of the player by matchmaking them with lower rank people and making the higher skill group player trouble ( Hard to Carry ) If they reupdate :  if they resume the rank system and add more rank to manage equally well that will then be a perfect 10/10 content/overall\n",

Even though they weren't busy, an error message kept popping up saying that they were, and it's not due to universal access being turned off.

      "The new update is awesome! The story is interesting and Dr. Merlot is a good villain (if only he's more prepared of course). Here's what I like to say:1. The models! Please, change it back to the old ones! I swear, Ruby was cross-eyed and her eyes are unnaturally far apart from each other and it's creeping me out!2. When I was playing as Blake, the sounds are muffled and the background music's gone. I don't know if I'm the only one have this problem but that's what happened even though the volume for the music is on max.3. I don't like the sounds when we're beating up the Grimm, sounded like muffled punch on a punching bag. Can it change to sounds from the show when Grimm being slashed?4. It's better if you put the controls tutorial in the game. Sometimes I have no clue about the controls for keyboard so having the tutorial would be nice to have a reference. 5. Since this is the full version of the game and you stated that you'll be focusing on releasing new contents, continue the campaign for the Merlot Industries story BUT with team JNPR. Or a different campaign story but playing as JNPR. 6. It's a bit too much to pay a high amount of money for this game despite the lack of content and the combat system is too bland. I have to agree that this should stay in early access so they can keep developing it UNTIL this game is worth to be full release. 7. The boss at Dr. Merlot's lab was TOO easy to beat. The radius of the Deathstalker's attack were small and easy to dodge. Try to play God Eater for once, maybe you can get an idea of how to make a really challenging boss fight which ACTUALLY worth the time to fight them.8. The ending of the campaign is also boring and depressing. Okay, Merlot is going to blow up the lab, won't having to escape the lab sequence would be nice instead of having an airship coming to pick you up? Make a timer, let us find a way to escape the lab, add Grimm/robots on the way to delay us. (like I said, play God Eater. Get an idea from the game since RWBY and God Eater are almost the same in concept.) 9. The campaign only took me like 2-3 hours to finish and then it's over. Wait for few more days and play it again to just freshened up your brain or kill time. That's it, I mean, the story can be interesting but it was too short, no details, nothing that makes the whole fighting to get to that point is worth it. Just... bleh. 10. No offense but engaging missions and storytelling? Everything is so straightforward and it's all just \"lets get this over with\" thing. Like I said, make everything worth the time of fighting the enemies. And please, exploring the world of Remnant? The course has been set and there's so many invisible walls that I could kill myself because I couldn't explore the area entirely!!There's a lot I could list down right now but that should be enough. And please, just consider the reviews we gave for this game. Some of us tell ourselves this is the bestest game we played and even recommended this to our friends. So please make this REALLY the best game we played. I can't recommend this game to my cousin anymore since it's actually disappointing and I don't want him to buy an expensive game from his favorite show only for it to be a huge disappointment for him. (I'm from Malaysia and here the price is RM47) Don't really recommend this game anymore. Don't buy it and it should stay as an early access or just hire a professional game tester to test this game before it released completely.\n",

      "Really actually a genuinely good game. A lot of depth, fun combat, great world to explore, clever monster mechanics and a continually expanding endgame makes this seemingly basic concept incredibly deep and will give you hours of fun with your friends (if you can figure out how to set up a stable server). The building mechanics are also a lot of fun but pretty consistant and kind of mundane. I would definately recommend this game 8/10.\n",

      "I love Garry's Mod first up. I've had some of the best times playing with friends on Sandbox and Trouble in Terrorist Town and murder and things like that. There are infinite add ons and so much fun to be had.But the multiplayer public servers are awful sometimes.If you have no friends online and you don't feel like sandbox, you can go on to multiplayer online to open servers to play TTT, murder, Prop Hunt, etc... But the people on these servers are just awful most of the time. What I've noticed is that there's a very limited selection of the types of people in Garry's Mod. Either it's the squealers that have the most annoying voices sometimes and say vulgar things, or 18 year olds that sound like they have nothing to do with their lives. I'm not saying all people are like this, but it's just how it usually is. RDMer's in TTT are the worst who kill for no reason, and another thing in TTT is how people are suspicious of the littlest of things. I cannot recommend the multiplayer servers.Another cheap sort of way to get money is to buy Counter-Strike: Source along with it. That's another $15 on the $10 price tag, and you (like me) may think \"I don't want to buy it\" and will probably wonder why it comes as a bundle. See, the thing is, that in Garry's Mod, if you don't have the certain texture or addon for an item or map, there will be huge red error signs and purple and black squares so you can't see the items. And some of the neccesities for this game in terms of maps and textures come with Counter-Strike: Source. And if you don't, you have to go online and find ALL THE TEXTURES and ALL THE MAPS in a bundle, open up your Steam folder and dragging them in. These packs take about half an hour to download, and you need to download all the gamemodes, excess maps and so many other things if you want to play online properly.  I mean, come on, at least give us a warning guys. To me this seems like a ripoff if you didn't know and a cheap way of getting money.Overall, I really love Garry's Mod, but I love it the most when I'm playing with friends on a private match or by myself in Sandbox. If you're gonna buy it for online multiplayer, I do not recommend it. If you're going to buy it to play with friends and the occasional online multiplayer, I fully recommend it.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Great gamemodes-A lot to do and downloadCons:-Bad community-Textures and addons (sometimes)I will keep Garry's Mod at a 7/10(i know this is a very negative review, but I just wanted to let you know the bad about Gmod before you buy it)\n",
      "In my opinion, FNaF 3 is the odd ball child of the series. It wraps up the story of the haunted animatronics, sorta. Its not too bad, but I don't think its very good either. I was a fan of the original. I thought it was a fun yet simple little horror game with a great style. I found the original and its sequel rather tense and scary. This one however, isn't scary. Its tense as hell but I wouldn't call its \"jumpscares\", jumpscares. The original 2 had its animatronics jumping over our desk, right at us. In FNaF 3 the one and only real animatronic (and even calling him an animatronic is a stretch) Springtrap leans in while opening his mouth, as if too say \"gotcha again! Wanna go another round??\" The closest we get to jumpscares are our old friends returing in hallucinations. But their jumpscares become predictable and will only scare you once or twice. Gameplay is what we've come to expect from the Five Nights series. Monitor the cameras, don't let the oogley boogleys get you. The no doors mechanic from the second game is still here, (again) sorta. Instead of a door into your office, you have a vent system under the main map with grates you can close. There are now multiple ways for our furry friend Springtrap to tell us to restart the game. It can be very tense, not knowing where hes coming from, but I still don't find the \"jumpscare\" scary. From door or vent, Springtrap fails to delight. There are secrets aplenty in this game, also multiple endings. Not much replay value though. I've made it past night 2 in this one (look at my reviews of FNaF and FNaF 2) but have since gotten bored and frustrated due to difficulty spikes in the 3rd night. I do recommend this game, just. Its an alright game, not scary but alright. Lets all hope that Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is good. Because from the looks of it, it's going to be what I've wanted since the original.ADDITIONAL NOTES: Scott Cawthon can be forgiven for Springtrap not having scary jumpscares, as he was using a new graphics enging while making the 3rd entry. I forgot to mention this. The 4th game will run on a simillar engine and has a longer development time than the first 3 and the jumpscares, animatronics and theme all look they'll make for good horror. I hope to get the 4th game day of release (as I've been doing since the 2nd game) because I must be honest, I kinda want to spend another Five Nights at Freddy's one last time.\n",
      "Biggest CS noob right here. This game is fun. Not many players on servers. I only found 1 that had a consistent 20 players at all times, but at least you can do bot matches. The shooting is great, the graphics are nice and don't look too dated. The only annoyance I have is with some of the sounds, which are straight from the original game. I know that all they did was port it to a new engine but at least they could've added in some new walking sounds. Get it on sale, or get it full price. Its worth every penny, trust me. Just keep in mind that there aren't many people who play this, so you might want friends to play with. If you're looking for a multiplayer shooter with lots of players, great shooting and great graphics, get Global Offensive. If you're looking for all of that, minus lots of players get CS: Source. Trust me, its worth it.\n",
      "My opinion has changed. While I find this game to be fun, it gets old very quickly. Nazi Zombies have been done to death at this point, the objectives are all the same and some missions are almost damn impossible on single player. It might be better with friends but I haven't played co-op so I wouldn't know. Hardly any sniping as you're always getting attack by hordes of Zombies. You can snipe a few but I always end up pulling out my machine gun and mowing them done that way instead. The graphics are the same as V2, aside fro everything being a lot darker. Boss fights are okay but again get old fast because the boss you're fighting decides to spawn a horde on you. Not much variety when it comes to enemies. You have standard Zombies, running kamikaze grenade zombies, big zombies with machine guns and jumping sniper zombies. You get all the guns from V2 straight away (except for some reason they're missing a few it seems) but special weapons can be found out in the feild, but with very little ammo for them. This is one of those times where I wish Steam had a meh button. If you're looking for a zombie shooter, buy Left 4 Dead or L4D2. Its coop and actually very fun. If you're looking for a good sniper game get V2. It is also coop (with 2 players) and very fun. If you just want a brainless (hah) shooter that is good for wasting time with get this I guess. But don't get Nazi Zombie Army 2. Its basically the same game but with different enviroments. JUST LIKE CALL OF DUTY LOLOLOLBut seriously don't bother.\n",

      "Saint's Row IV is definetly one of the better games I've played; with witty and comedic dialogue, various missions, and lots of activities and fun objectives packed into this game. I must say, the super-powerd gameplay is also extremely fun to use and is a welcome change to the franchise in my opinion. As well as all the fun packed into this game, there are SO many refrences and easter eggs, and parodies in the story and the side quests. This game also includes co-op, which when played with friends, is always a fun time. All the weapons and vehicles are unique, making them fun to use and customize.The map however, is sometimes bland and plain but when you are busy speeding and gliding around the city, it doesn't matter much. Now, the customization. Character cuztomization is EXTREMELY detailed with so many options to make you boss truly yours and have fun with. The weapon customization is a nice touch given that they are already so fun to use. Weapon customization also allows you to change the way it looks, the stlye it shoots, and sound effects too.The game's graphics are just fine if you don't really care about it and it looks good enough for me. The game can also run on a low-spec pc which was good news to me because my pc runs games like crap and sometimes games are buggy but luckily, it runs fine for me and should run well for you too.So, given the fact that I've already completed gives me a right to say how amazing and fun it is. I'm very excited for the newest installation to the series: Gat Out Of Hell which is another standalone action packe super powered Saint's Row I am ver excited for.Overall, I give it a 10/10 In my opinion based on my experience.A video review of Saint's Row IV will be up on my channell \"Dat Wolf\" very soon.Go check it out later and Maybe Subscribe! :DThanks for reading!\n",
      "Amazing game, I bought it for a friend and I so we can play together (I would love a 4 Co-Op mode). But I would like to see more bosses because the 4 main bosses are kinda bad and repetitive. Hope to see what you do with this game, it has alot of potential.\n",
      "This game...This ♥♥♥♥ing game. Sure its a good game and all but, I cant play with any friends i cant even see what a IP Is. And worst of all alot of times i get stuck not being able to equip anything and just walk around cars waiting or them to explode, Its the only way to kill zombies for me SINCE I CANT EQUIP ♥♥♥♥! Even with the \"Equip button in the menu and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 And 0 Keys, I give this 3/10 Shitloops\n",
      "Unturned is a point and click adventure based around friendship, love and loyalty. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I can see why others can't. This game was aimed at a specific group of people, plus the optimization is F**king putrid some people can't even load the game without CTD and some people even with GTX 1080s are having low fps stutters and dips etc , fortunately I haven't had many of these issues.  They lied about the game having multiplayer on release so none of that pvp stuff for you competitive people out there, planet generation is somewhat repetitive with some planets looking flatout the same and no gas giants so there's no sense of realism here. The creatures can look pretty intresting i might add, also even if this game had multiplayer they made the universe a bit too big so good luck finding your friends if they ever add multiplayer/coop, Trading is really good IMO but after you get to a certain point money can kinda become useless. Overall this game gets a 5.5/10, Great concept, very lacking final product. I really hope future updates change this.Edit: Now i'm getting Crashes at startup, TAKE THIS L NMSEdit: I absolutely hate this game after seeing the same planet over and over again? Sean murray lied to our faces.Edit: Trying to go for a refund hopefully I get it so I can spend it on something I can have fun with.\n",
      "I have played a lot of FPS and other types of shooters, (just check out my games list or the hours I've racked up on CS:GO), but I can honestly say I've never played a game with the nail-biting action, graphics and hardcore intense realistic game play like I've seen with Insurgency. This game really has it all for me and cultivates an atmosphere that keeps me (and my discerning GF) coming back for more over and over and over again. The team work that it promotes, the user community, (most) of the players (awesome and friendly) and the back and forth action between stealthy movement and tense exploring (in hunt especially) following by often brutal, but fair, firefights (except that damn RPG), that are like living breathing things. I have rarely felt so immersed in a game as I do with Insurgency and I don't think in the 30+ years of gaming that I've done that I've put in any where near this many hours. I was shocked when I realized that I'd eclipsed my time on CS:GO, but after a moment of thought, was not really surprised. CS:GO is a great game and so are a lot of the other military FPS style games, but I really feel that no one has done so much on such a limited budget and resource group as Insurgency as... and for SO LITTLE MONEY!I have bought (through Steam and then Humble Bundle) no less than a dozen copies for friends and family to spread the goodness... and I'm a cheap old sod. :)Go out, get a copy and jump in to the fight... and don't forget to say 'hi'.\n",
      "Garrys mod is a fun game with many gamemodes pre installed with the game. Its price could definetly be higher and people would still get the game. There are many addons you can get with steam workshop and you can create your own little empires. You can fly in planes, Drive cars and other things, There is guns and a lot more than just that. There are many online multiplayer servers which have the gamemodes and can have plugins and mods installed alswell which can slow people down joining. This game is very multiplayer based so get your friends to buy the game as well.The game is very good and for the hours ive played i will still continue to play this epic game.\n",
      "Awesome game. Great to play with friends but there are a few hackers in online.\n",
      "This is a game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the FPS, shoot-em-up, looting style genre. The content is packed with witty and memorable characters who forge the storyline to be one that you won't forget. Endless hours can be put into the game once you buy some DLCs and is especially more enjoyable to play co-op with friends. As well as the combat system being excellent, the skill tree allows you to customise your character in many different ways. As well as earning skill points, \"badass\" ranks are another aspect of the game which allows you to improve your character's stats even further. I would recommend to absolutely anyone. 9/10\n",

      "For a game that has sold 6 million copies (as of 17 Sept 2014), Gmod still continues to have glitches, errors and map mishaps causing joining friends' servers to become more torturous than need be.Yes, one CAN go read forums for solutions to problems and issues. However, when problems keep continuously happening over and over again, one tires of spending the majority of their time on the game frustratedly trying to fix the game instead of actually playing it.Although, in those rare moments that the game manages to load properly for everyone playing together, it is an immensely enjoyable game to play with friends. At first I recommended it to everyone, however, the more people I played with, the more problems (that could be fixed easily by updates) seemed to arise. Maps, content or textures that people had already owned would not register when they tried to play the game and either resulted in the person not being able to join the server at all (wouldn't even let them download the missing items from the workshop), or joining a server with huge error signs and checkers causing massive lag.10/10 for fun and entertainment, 0/10 for ease of playing. Please, fix this awesome game.\n",
      "This game isn't as bad as I was expecting. Keep in mind the last COD game I played was Black Ops 2. This game is fun to muck around with it's cheaper price at the moment I believe it's worth it. So far I've only tried MP and Zombies so i cannot give a review of the story, I don't expect much however.Let's start with the Cons:HUGE FRAME RATE ISSUES - Seriously fix this asap! The lag kills.Latency issues - A few times I think I've been placed on servers that aren't from my regionKillstreaks aren't new - All the killstreaks are basically reskinned from olders, not much new content hereAuto Shotguns - (Do I need to explain this further?)Controls were difficult to change - Issues with sliding and crouching after changing controlsPros:Multiplayer actually feels fresh - (From when I last played atleast)Lots of customization - Guns are customizable, skins, attachments, characters and so on.Jetpack and wall running - Need I say more? Who doesn't love a firefight whilst sprinting along a wall?Zombies looks crazy - I've played a tiny amount, but it seems like there is so much content here.I recommend this game if you're looking for some fun, either alone or with friends. I also advise you to buy it when it's cheap.\n",

      "This is the greatest game I have every played and I think that everybirdie should play it. It combines the enjoyment, complexity and reality of a high school girl trying to find a boyfriend and my extraordinary love for pigeons. My only criticism of this game is that the game is not long enough in order to truly connect with its characters and feel like I had a true and real relationship with the pigeons in the story.\n",
      "Bored? Then go play this awesome game! Build your gun to customize your play style, ask you friends to join you, then beat the crap out of them with the weapon YOU created!\n",
      "The gameplay is fun and addictive at first but the gamemodes become repetitive after a while. Also the AI spams RPGs constantly which often times wipes out your entire team before a single bullet is shot. Enemy AI can sometimes spawn right beside you or you'll respawn right beside a group of them resulting in your quick death.The friendly AI is annoying because they just follow you everywhere. They don't follow orders and they don't go anywhere on their own. Often times, they'll crowd around you and get you killed.The only positives I can give this game is the gun battles that do happen without RPG spam and the enemy AI is fun to play against. I'd make this a positive review if RPGs were made optional or decrease their number among the AI and the ability to issue orders to friendly AI via the voice command menu. The way the game handles spawns is funky in a lot of ways and needs revising. As it is, the current build leaves me feeling unsatisfied.\n",

The game is also quite buggy. I have had numerous, 'what?', moments while playing. Once they add a lobby with friends system and fix a majority of glitches, I will recommend this game to anyone who likes horror styled games.\n",
      "This game is a mmorpg and does seem like a clone of other popular mmorpg's such as World of Warcraft but as you will see it is much more. However with a price tag of $0 a month it is a must have! The whole concept of Rifts and alternant dimensions makes it feel not just like a clone! Rift is a fun and well structured game with a friendly user base and supportive staff that really try and make your gaming experience as smooth as possible.\n",
      "As someone who has enjoyed previous Plainswalkers games I was very suprised to see  what seemed like a high quality MTG game go free to play on steam. I was getting ready to finally be able to show friends who were into other TCG's why MTG is one of the greatest around and why Blue/White is anoying as balls. However as it is right now, the game is basically unplayable. The online servers have not once been avaliable in the time I've attempted to play, which is close to an hour of game time wasted as all single player quests and tutorials completed while offline do not get saved, not even locally. I understand we have no reason to really complain as we haven't paid for anything, however I feel as if Stainless Games has a lot to answer for. This game and its servers are no where near up to an industry acceptable standard.\n",

A lot of sequencing and thinking required to get the best efficiency per block used. Feels pretty polished and the difficulty increases as you progress. You can also revisit past puzzles to try and make them more efficient or beat your friends in the two categories by making a superior 'factory.' Great little game that should give anyone's brain a tease.\n",

      "Sanctum 2 successfully merges fps and tower defense games. The multiplayer is fun, the graphics are good and it is enjoyable to play. Enemy types vary and require different tactics to defeat, making you plan your towers, weapons and perks carefully. I would've liked to see upgrading your primary and secondary weapons through the game, and a selection of primary weapons for each class, but it doesn't bug me too much. The story is barely there, with about two comic-like pictures before each level, and besides the map and enemies, gameplay doesn't change much between levels. Sure, you get new towers, secondary weapons and perks as you go along, but I was hoping on each level that some flying spaceship thing would come and help. The boss fights are really fun, as the boss destroys your buildings and fuels your rage to  destroy it. Without any expansions the story is short aswell, but it does get hard and can take a bit of grinding. The amount of detail put into each map is brilliant aswell, with little bits to explore and objects to interact with. Overall, this is a nice game to play with your friends, by yourself and sometimes with random people over the internet (Unless they hop in on the last wave, destroy all your towers before you notice and have time to act, then leave). 7.5/10\n",

You have a range of characters to choose and all you try to do is be the fastest and get ahead before you get left behind from the others and explode into \"the walls\". It's a simple task but very fun and tricky with all the powerups and other awesome things included in this game. It can be raging to some people though, but trust me at least give it a go because it is SO FUN. Especially with friends! The graphics are simple so you don't need that great of a graphics card which is good and there are a whole load of  maps by default but you can also choose a bunch of other maps made by other players. It really is a great and competitive game!\n",
      "This game reminds me of Minecraft and DayZ but especially DayZ and to say that about a free game is BRILLIANT. The game is so good with many weapons to use to slice, shoot, bash and more to those annoying zombies and the maps are great but make sure that if you go on the Arena map that u are with some friends because if you aren't then you will get pretty bored... trust me there isn't much in that map for 1 person. BUT the other map is EPIC it is huge, filled with towns, militairy bases, barns and more with awesome and I mean AWESOME weapons and other materials for you to use to survive the undead world. But the multiplayer is a let down since you can hardly get into a server in fact i don't even know if you CAN get into a server with the complication of ip's, port's and stuff but the developer might update that so I still recommend this game because of the EPIC singleplayer and if your thinking what the controls will be like and if they are like DayZ's alien controls then don't worry the controls on Unturned are great and you can adjut them if you want anyway. Oh and there is stuff like customization to your character. WOW this is alot like DayZ but just with Minecraft themed graphics. So much to do in this game and it's FREE so i suggest you go and annihilate some zombies in Unturned!\n",

Reign Of Kings doesnt have an option where you can sprint across the entire map in a few seconds and teleport through stone walls, therefore allowing the person to take all of your hard earned items. I am actually infuriated by the hackers. They take all of the fun outof the game and crush your experiance of the game. If the game could look at the reports you put on players. I payed $19.99USD for this game, and i use AUD so i payed an extra $6.65 to be greeted by hackers.\n",

      "So, here we have a game where you thrash zombies for a living. Not to mention living, for a living.This game was a bit complicated when you first pick it up, especially without a friend to help you out with some neat old tips, but it's easy to get into after a little bit. In this game there are three vanilla (not including moded zombies like hellsgate map explosive zombies XD), Runners, Walkers and Kiddies. Be weary of kids, though small, consider them a zombie version of a ninja assassion. Small and fast. There are Runners which will sprint at you and grapple you unless you push em away with v. same with walkers but they dont sprint. Oh and theres the player zombies from fallen infected comrades which are slightly tougher thern the runners. As you just heard, if you get grappled you will get bitten by a zombie and may even get infected unless you quickly shoot/kill it or push it away. There are also the many many guns and weapons you can use, including the badass grenades, molotovs and tnt's. The ammo management is quite complex compared to things like cod where only certain guns can take certain ammo. E.g. a winchester rifle uses 357. ammo as does the S&W so if you expect it to be like cod zombies this is not what your looking for.With that aside I have had a lot of laughs and many fun hours with this game with my friends. There is an endless amount of fun you can have with this game in general, and I hope this review gave yall mates a breif idea of what this game is like! ;)\n",

      "A perfect game, the story of Geralt the Riv concluded. The game is masterfully presented, the devs have been updating this game with new content like the free-LC they provided after launch gave us new contracts and eye candy and those important gwent cards. They have also been updating the performance and fixing little annoyances, like those annoying torches over treasure chests. I had defaulted to medium-low on launch day, I am now running on ultra/high at a solid 40-50 frames. The story is a long epic, with little diversions and side quests that feel like they should have their own whole game chapters. The side quests have memorable dialogues and twists and turns that give you multiple different endings and scences, begging to get you to play this game again and see what each one has to offer. Some of the quests involving curses get me so indecisive, becuase ghosts always trick me and I end up someone dying or something happening and I just lose myself and get really sad.Each section of the main story touches on a moral choice, like family ties, racial differences, domestic abuse, sexual preferences, you name it. The grey perspective of no right or wrong really gets you to think about what would be the best choice in a world full of evil monsters, and even if you make the choice which you think no one gets hurt, sooner or later you will find a repercussion or three of what you decided to do in your situation.Exploring around the games distinct envrionments is really something wonderful. The swamps of Velen are just fetid mud and composting corpses and monsters ready to drag you to their hellhole homes. Novigrad is a contrast to this, green rolling fields and tall swaying trees, pictuesque and lush. The cold hard islands of Ard Skellig are beautiful, but they house many fierce denizens and the people are just as harsh. The view from Kaer Trolde is possibly the most beautiful scene ever made onto a computer sceen.Playing around with combat can feel a little clunky on a keyboard, horse combat takes a while to get used to. When you go on an expedition to a high spot and hit the wrong button and make Geralt jump off a cliff is rather bothersome. But all these movement skills come with time, and are easy to get adjusted too.Roleplaying as a witcher on a monster contract when you read up the beastiary and prepare potions, bombs and oils makes this just a wonderful experience.When you reach end game content and the specialised Witcher gear the powerful bonuses they give each talent tree are huge, which makes many other armor's obselete, but this doesn't mean much if you think the armor looks cool, like the Ursine set, but c'mon devs, griffen armor is just 'the dad bod' of armors... That aside the armors are extremely powerful and make other armor you find relatively useless, sidetracking you to find the nearest shopkeeper to battle him at gwent and then make him lose his money as you thrash him and then sell him your unwanted gear. The difficulty scale is very noticable when you are lower level, as your gear comes with less augmentations and you possess less skills and equipment, but higher tiered combat is more forgiving, excpet some of those pesky bosses!The visual downgrade from E3 2014, while noticable, does not subtract from this game looking beautiful, check out my sceenshots to see how good they are! There are some mods upgrading the visuals, I am yet to try them out,  but personally they don't look to do much.Every inch of this game is perfect, going home to Kaer Morhen is beautiful, seeing little clues left around from previous games is heartwarming, the devs rememeber their games and make them flow so well. When you arrive at White Orchard, see the devastation left behind in the war between Nilfgaard and the North, it really shows you how destructive it can be. The little township had changed hands, fights between natives and newcomers are all about to boil over and there is barely anything that can prevent this, the Nilfgaardians swagger around and then they get disrespected at the tavern, then they beat up the locals, it is really a spectacle to watch. Nothing about this game made me want to stop playing, but my choices made me weep during the ending, seeing old and new friends die...The perfect ending to a perfect series, this game is a must play for honestly everyone, it is probably the best game I have ever played.DLC hype is building\n",
      "Witcher 2 inspires awe, every game you play after you finish this game is a slight dissapointment. The story in this game has so many different choices and endings it feels like a different game everytime you choose a different path. The graphics are unreal and beat everything realeased, even today, the animations and voice acting is superb and the sounds are so clear and music is amazing and it fits really well into the dark fantasy world. There are some memorable tracks to this game which have made their way into my playlists.The combat style is not different from most rpg's, hack and slash, magic spells (called signs) and potions. Some people say it came out as half baked, but I love it and it really gets you to think about your stategy, especially against large groups of enemies. The constanting rolling around that you ahve to do to avoid enemy attacks is rather tiresome, as blocking is ineffective against many different enemies. The different skill trees are all very well balanced and each skill impacts combat and how you play big time. The drawback with the alchemy system is that potions can only be consumed outside of combat, so constantly saving before entering a new room is advisable, so it is possible to reload without worrying if you have lost a large portionof time spent doing quests. The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia is a badass monster slayer who you just love form first sight (much like his hot girlfriend Triss!!). And the most hyped up and important part of the game, the story is written and directed like a AAA movie title, only ten times better! Going through the prologue is like watching Game of Thrones, it is awesome.This game also utilises Witcher 1 saves so all the different choices and descisions you made in that, impact your Witcher 2 game! The story's allusions to the whole witcher univerrse allow you to roleplay the witcher effectively, but the main plot pulls Geralt out of his main profession, he turns away from his witchering throughout much of the main plot, with only a few quests showing off his full monster hunting aspect. This game is magnificent, it is a visual feast and contains a plot which constantly twists and turns and gets you to think long and hard about decisions you make over your favourite characters.Overall - 99/100 Must play!\n",

      "A fun, open-world sandbox game. Essentially, a 2-D Minecraft with more stuff and some new gameplay aspects. It can be quite limited at times, and there's no deep story-line (which you wouldn't expect from sandbox game), although the Corruption and Hollow and some nice competition.The game is generally fun, and more focused on exploration and combat than anyhting else, but is fun nontheless. If you're playing alone, it's pretty good game. If you're playing with friends, brilliant game.8/10\n",
      "Sanctum is a competent tower defence game combined with a fun FPS aspect. This combination, although it may sound strange, works like a charm. There is nothing more satisfying in this game than setting up an impressive defense which obliterates all foes, and destroying anything left with a huge plast from your Rex.An arsenal of weapons and tower choices makes this game diverse, and even more fun to play with friends to gt the best combination possible.A very solid game, and an excellent multiplayer experience make this a joy to play.\n",

      "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is another installment in the game's series and is quite an amazing game. Really, I only got to get this game through steam sales and the normal price tag of the game will explain the seemingly unreasonable prices for good weapon skins on steam market.Anyway about this counterstrike game, it is a great FPS for a comparably cheaper price than other well-known ones and provides a good player base for people from Australia to play (I am only mentioning Aust. but its a wide spread game) and playing with friends is actually fun. The ranking system I guess is adequate but sometimes a little off-the-mark. Sometimes the system pairs you up with really high ranked people leaving you behind in the scoreboard. I understand that when moving up from Silver to Nova makes u verse Novas but sometimes its a little unfair.All in all, CS:GO is a great game not just to play by yourself; get your friends on this :D . It's an amazing game by Valve.\n",
      "CSGO is that friend that everyone hates, but still gets invited to all the parties.\n",

      "Provided you like the open world, survival, crafting genre, you should find many hours of enjoyment here.I believe this was the first of the genre I tried back in alpha 7. It was a rough but, totally playable game back then. The developers are evidently very committed to delivering a high quality product as they have continued to improve the game since it was available.I find my enjoyment is multiplied when I can find a friendly server where users return. The coop PVE mode works very well and its great when you have a community developing an area all at once.\n",
      "9/10, a fantastic gem of a game. It incorporates elements of minecraft, with the crafting, building and general look of the game, whilst also including core elements from day z - with survival elements of food, water, sickness, blood becoming important. You'll spend a lot of time raiding towns for crucial gear and a lot of time fighting zombies who literally cannot be \"de-aggro'd\" (the old \"walk through some trees and lose the zombies\" doesn't apply here). The fun increases exponentially when you play with a friend, you can create a base using the massive and (mostly) easy to follow crafting menu/crafting wiki. Setting up a base is a very satisfying experience but it should be noted that players and zombies can destroy and player built structure. The game runs smoothly at the lowest settings on my potato of a rig, but I’ve noticed that any attempt to increase the graphics leads to excessive fps drop. The lowest settings are still significantly better than minecraft graphics, though, so fear not. Currently there is not a server browser for unturned, this makes playing online somewhat of a tedious adventure.. Currently your best bet of finding a server is trolling through the steam servers and hoping to find an IP address/server that isn't full and is actually hosting at the time. I've personally had more success with hamachi servers than the standard IP ones, but even then it's very hit and miss. IF you can find a good PVP server it is great fun and I’d highly recommend trying it out. The survival elements on a PVP match can be too unforgiving though, and frequently you die of starvation/thirst (of course player related deaths are common, too). But there's nothing quite like hunting down the player who killed you last and killing them with three awfully aimed body shots from your scavenged mosin nogant (praise the Russians for their weapon prowess) and then stealing their poncho and tea-bagging the absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ out of their raided, bullet ridden corpse (rip never 4get). Whilst on the topic of player v player combat, BULLETS HURT and you bleed quite significantly after being shot. This is a great bit of realism that makes pvp skirmishes that much more strategic. I'll probably never forget having to use my trousers as a bandage to stop the bleeding from a bullet wound incurred from a friend who was \"trying to test the range of the rifles\", what a fething scrubl0rd. I have some gripes about the crafting system, namely how difficult it is to find a canteen or to craft one. I fail to see why we can't use an empty tin can/water bottle to collect water, in fact I fail to see why we can't just drink from the water using the players block like hands (dafuq?). Also it is quite difficult to craft new magazines using empty magazines and combining them with boxes of ammunition. This is mostly due to the fact that empty magazines take up one free inventory slot EACH and cannot be stacked like regular magazines/shells. This makes finding/creating a dependable supply of magazines quite frustrating. I do however like the fact that empty magazines drop to the ground (unless it's your last one) when you reload, this system makes it much more realistic. But it's still an early access game so these things maybe changed in the future.DESPITE THIS, the game is epic. It is free. It is fun to play. It's hilarious with friends AND for a measly 50mb download you literally have no reason not to give it a try. TLDR; Great game get on it scrubl0rds. \n",
      "I love the standalone so far. Was playing with a couple of friends being boss. We were completely kitted out, we all had camo clothing and some good weapons.We decided we would quickly go check the supermarket in one of the towns and obtain some food items, whilst searching. a random floor zombie appeared and attacked usWe killed the zombie but one of my friends shot at it which alerted another floor zombie and it proceeded to attack us.This time with this zombie we decided to take the more stealthy approach and use of fire axes, two of us charged at the zombie axes swingingWe both missed the zombie and ended up hittinh each other, We both instantly diedWooooooooo!!!!!!

      "DayZ can be a fun game if your going solo, but the real fun is when you invite a few friends and go on merry adventures. The game may still be in alpha, but its still heaps of fun.\n",
      "Have you ever secretly had a lust to be bummed in your sleep by a weeaboo who has way more time to invest in a video game then you? Well look no further. The amount of times you will be absolutely poo'd on by some 12 year old who's mum is an alcoholic and doesn't care about what time he stays up to as long as the little turd isn't in her hair, and then wake up the next morning on the beach in rust, after you just started to get your base off the ground is insane. Sometimes I consider uninstalling the game, but you sometimes get these temporary lapses of wanting to have fun. This is of couse ruined by the various collection of weeaboo's, neckbeards and no lifers of the like who invest way to much time in the video games then at school, work or other various necessities of society. The game is good, The fun is definitely had, but if someone spends more time on this game then you chances are you are screwed. Also the shooting mechanics are so sloppy, honestly the cheap cs-go recoil rip off  causes guns to miss most bullets/ not register and sometimes causes my stools to harden and therefore causes them trouble in dropping from the depths of my buttocks.  You have to buy this game basically, but you will have a very strong love hate relationship with it.  OH and play with friends otherwise the chances of you quitting are at least 90.00%\n",

      "Terraria is a game loaded with content and is very fun to play by yourself or with your friends. 44/50\n",
      "I like this game quite a bit, there are much better MMORPG's with the same non target style but you don't come across as many as you think. Some pros are:- The Aforementioned action style combat rather than tab-targeting system- There is item enhancement and auction house (ala Archeage, WoW, etc)- The PVP aspect of the game (May be a problem for many people but that's why the PVE server was made)- There are quite a bit of classes to choose from (gender locked with certain races like demon gets top and bottom male and middle female, and humans get top and bottom female and middle male, so it sort of evens out.- Quite a good amount of people for a slightly new MMO- The skills are a bit less then most MMO's but they are easy to get as you can get most in about 3-5 hrs- Enemy's are fun to fight and the game is quite difficult (depending on the class you choose- You don't have to grind much unless your going for lvl 40 (good luck) really quickly- PVP is great due to the aforementioned action style combat- The download isn't so much so great to try out for a bitEven thought I say it's a good game, it's got quite a bit of cons- Graphics are not as good as most new MMO's (I don't care but some people do)- High lvls can spam kill newbies depending on their moral compass- The server is pretty stable but I ran into a few server glitches and some 10 second disconnects because of the server-  I ran into a few bugs ( one including when I started the game Fluffy got stuck inside the wood of a carriage) but not that many- Some spelling and grammatical errors- Many things you can buy but not \"Pay2Win\" (Mostly cosmetics and mounts but there are weapons.I like this game and I am still playing it, as long as my internet holds up :(. I seriously recommend you play this with a friend because you can team against bosses and dungeons, do quests, and you will run into many pvpers on your journey so having more than one person will usually grant you your win, or intimidate your opponent. I recommend it and I will hope to see you out there :)\n",

Not to mention the DLC is free! This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most well executed games I have played and will every play. Hats off to Freebird Games for giving us this piece of art. I'll be giving A Bird Story a go and if it's even half as good as this was I'll be over the moon *unintentional pun I swear*I cannot recommend this enough, buy it and steam share your library to your friends if they do not wish to purchase it; it's a must play.10/10\n",

      "Mount&Blade is an open-ended game in the same vein as Darklands or Elite. Theplayer takes the role of the leader of a wandering band of soldiers andwarriors. The player then sets his or her own goals, whether they be of amercantile, heroic, or tyrannical nature. To accomplish these goals, theplayer will engage in dynamic and deep combat using everything from throwingdaggers to military picks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. Basically it is a snad box game that can be very realistic. You can LOSE battles. It is not just a button masher as far as combat goes, there is strategy and skill involved in the fighting. Graphics are ok as of version 1.011. I like that you can do whatever you want. Roam the land killing bandits, solo if oyu like. You can amass a huge force of soldiers. If a kingdom you are friends with is under siege, you cancome to the resque. Or you can take over villages, towns, kindoms castles.

      "It's a nice game. It makes you think.Like the ultimate consequences of your actions as you kill or spare your 'enemies'.It (apparently) makes people cry.Haven't yet met any toxic community members of this game.Sound track is great. Some people say it's mediocre, and I can see why, as the loops of music don't end subtly enough, which is kinda annoying when you realise that the song just repeated. But damn, the music does hit the spot well, as it suits the battle you are currently fighting.What I found bad though, would be the idea of repetitive playing, just to get a different ending. Some people like playing the same game multiple times to get different endings, such as many VNs since the beginning of time. But as for me, I just can't be bothered. But that's it. The bad really only applies to people who don't like to repeat the same thing to get different outcomes. (There are minor changes to the dialogue that make you think, that's what was fueled me to play another playthrough of the game)I still like the game. It's creative. It sparked me and my friend to think about making games. (Not saying this game alone was the tipping point, it just further fueled us to want to make a game.)But yeah, enough about me.

It's a great game to play with your friends (you'd be suprised but it is really fun to watch your friends yell when you don't get them together) I enjoy this game a lot and even when I saw it I thought it would be very childish but look at the names of the resturants (There's one called Jerk King and Tai Me up) You might want to try it out, it's a good fun little game!\n",
      "This game is redonkulously hard. It's not fun just starting the game with the hill and your friends get shot straight away because they just wanted to charge an be heroes while they crawl to you afterwards wanting to get healed but instead I put them out of thier miseries with my pistol for 2 reasons is that I wanted to be greedy and as for the other it was to just teach them a lesson.

      "Played a game with my friend as Navara, he was the newly founded Portugal, we worked together to take out all the sand ♥♥♥♥♥s in the area. After that we turned our attention to Castill who had recently ate up Leon and most of Galacia. We knew Castill would dominate us militarily because we went on heaps of crusades and had defended against many muslim jihads thus our army size was greatly reduced (I had a levy of 1000 vs castill's levy of 17000). Castill declared war on me and I knew I was going to loose, however all was not lost because my son was somehow heir to the throne of Castill–three years later he died of 'suspicious circumstances' but all was not lost because I had another son in line for the throne–who had also suffered the same fate as his 13 year old bother. I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by this stage but I still had one more son who was originally third in line to the throne of Castill. And yes he was also assassinated, by then I didn't have any holdings to the throne of Castill but at least the last assassination revealed the culprit of these untimely and convenient deaths and it was no other than the King of Portugal himself. 10/10 would end a friendship again\n",
      "Probably one of the best sandboxes ever.The first thing I would say about this game is the amount of addons (If you can think of something it will most likely be an addon) The freedom to do almost everything you want, from making contraptions, 3D art, cooperative maps to multiplayer game modesThe features allow you to manipulate objects (You can change colour, texture, poses, physics, AI behaviour and much more)You can have fun by your self in sandbox or online but i recommend playing with friendsThe only con I can think of is hardware:It requires little hardware for minor things but like all sandbox games it requires a powerful computer to process everything a a large hard drive for everything\n",
      "This game is a hidden gem among the deep heart of steam's heart.Half Life 2 Deathmatch throws all the HL2 weapons and throws you in an amazing selection of maps to fight in.This game is the lovely old deathmatch styled games. You either kill, or be killed! No hiding like games nowdays. You are the man, the badass, the ♥♥♥♥. Skill is everything, not some weapon you need to buy for 5 dollars.Half Life 2 Deathmatch takes the badassness to the next level. You get to throw toilet bowls at each other with the gravity gun and get to time frags like a boss.Sadly, the fans of deathmatches aren't as popular as the past. So recommend this piece of badassery to your friends.10/10 Can shoot toilet bowls\n",

      "This game for when it launched brought so many innovations in open world gaming (sandbox).Now, 12 years later still remains as my favourite game, as the first time i played it back in summer of 2002. it was a birthday gift from my best friend. the only thing the game misses is inbuilt multiplayer mode, but luckily mod communities have brought this too in this spectacular game, It's the first 3D game in the GTA series. This game is history, period.\n",

      "My god I love this game. I'm not sure what the entire game is like because I only played Karin's story but I loved it to bits. The entire plot is great and is super heart warming. You really start to warm up to the characters and I wouldn't be surprised if people actually started having full fledged crushes on some of the main characters. It gets a little bit boring at times but it was probably just me being impatient. I'm gonna get my friends to check out this game because every time I play it makes me fell so happy it's crazy. It would make me the happiest person ever if you made  a sequel where you go back to live with them after either breaking up with the one you chose or continuing the story with the relationship still going. Either way I would love to see some sort of follow up. You have my full support the whole way. (Also can I just say that the soundtrack is amazing and I would've loved to here some more songs with lyrics or just somewhere I can get the mp3s to this game because I would listen to them every day) It would probably ruin the point of the story but I would love to see this english dubbed one day. I would replay the entire game.\n",
      "I am scared of the night, in games like this especially. Wolves,boars,dragons and so on. Watched a youtuber trying out the game, gets motivated to buy it. Buys the game. Plays the game for 2 hours in Multiplayer. Raging because I died of cold. [All because I needed one more stone.] 15 minutes into finding my friend in the cold night. Its morning, builds a house. Lives in house. A strong man chases after me and my friend. We ran and hide in the forest. Staring at the man from behind a tree. He chases me. A wolf saves me by distracting the man. Escapes. Makes armour for friend and me, hunts the man down. Kills the man. Loots the man. Prosper in the game. Run out of wood. Its night time. Sees a boar. Hides in house cause I am \"Shadow fearful\". I hide in the house till my friend comes in. He asks for food. We go hunting for food. Remembers about the boar. Refuses to go out. My friend goes out. I check my inventory, alot of items in the vinicity. Looks like my friend's items. Screams in horror. Opens door.What happens? That is for you to find out.This game looks very promising. Although it is in early stages, I already find it better than alot of games. Although the combat does need improvement [Bows bows bows bows] but the game is VERY REALISTIC [Opinion Alert]. However, it is very rage inducing as very few items are given to you at the start. The world is so big that finding your friend takes HOURS. [Is this a compliment to saying the map is huge?]. I try to imagine the future multiplayer. Sleath take-downs on players/creatures. Walls for defending, playing rent for living in people's houses :3. Archer towers where I hire people to be archers on night shift with their bows, placable torches. BOATS AND NEW ISLANDS [HOHOHO MAYBE NOT THIS MAP IS TOO HUGE FOR ME AT THE MOMENT XD] *Note:This is what I think ONLY.*Overall,This game, Is definitely a game you will want to buy\n",

If you enjoy games such as stepmania, or audiosurf then you will love this game.

      "Nostalgic is the feeling that you should get when playing this fantastic game. This is the squeal to the famed and fantastic game, Star Wars Battlefront (1). The campaign takes place in the mid-late Clone Wars era. You play as a battle-hardened soldier from the 501st legion (aka Vader's Fist) lead by Jedi Knight/General Anakin Skywalker. The campaign takes you through multiple planets and systems such as: Mygeeto, Kashyyyk,  Felucia, Utapau, Kamino, Hoth, The Death Star and many other planets/battle grounds. Not only can you play as Clone Troopers, Droids, Rebels and Storm Troopers, but you can also play as many different Jedi and Sith. Gameplay wise, you are able to play as 6 Different Classes. These include: Normal Infantry, Heavy, Scout, Engineer, Special class 1, Special class 2 and Jedi/Sith (You will need to unlock these characters through points earned during the battle). Did I mention you can also use and command a variety of different vehicles? From small AT-RT's to Gigantic AT-AT's, these are only some of the MANY different vehicles that are able to be used. Having multiple tanks on your side can mean a swift victory for you and your team. But what if you are going against them? Well, mines and rockets are always available for your use in demolitions. In this Battlefront, you are also able to participate in space battles. They too, are fantastic and fun to play. Multiplayer wise, the Game Spy severs for this game have been shut down. Although, don't give up your hope. Third Party hosts such as Game Ranger allow you to host and join servers set up by other people. This can still supply you and your friends with the nostalgia received from this amazing game. Here is the Game Ranger site: http://www.gameranger.comEven the best games have a few little flaws here and there. A few things I think that should've been included in this game  can include more squad commands. In the previous Battlefront, there were 4 commands. They include; 'Follow Me', 'Move out', 'Hold Position' and 'At Ease'. These squad commands can prove to be extremely helpful for strategically capturing command posts and ultimately, winning battles. It also would've been good if they added commands for star fighters. For example, if you pressed the 'Follow Me' key, the fighter you were looking at would start following you and so on.  All in all, this game is very fun, balanced and extremely enjoyable for both Star Wars and Non-Star Wars fans alike. I can't wait for the next Battlefront game. If you do at any time, get bored of the same maps, you can always download mods from the Battlefront community. They can supply you and your friends with an endless amount of fun! I'll give this game a 10/10, it's absolutely fabulous! If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't got it yet, buy it immediately!\n",
      "All i can say, is that this needs co-op. So i sit down with a friend and say \"Okay, lets go kill this stupid boss.\" Like really.. Hopefully they make a number 2 {they may be already} and make it co-op. You can only make this game better by being able to run around with a friend chopping things with a sword that with rediculous traits.\n",
      "If you've ever played a Moba you'll know that such games have a rather steep if rewarding learning curve.Awesomenauts manages to mitigate that often frustrating learning period somewhat and makes the overall experience more enjoyable.That said the game is no less competitive and is worth your time if you like the idea of a 2D platforming Moba style game.The main weakness compared to traditional Mobas is the smaller number of both items, abilities and heroes (I stress the word 'compared').However it makes up for it in the unique way it handles the former two.Instead of buying items you buy your skills and upgrades.The interesting thing here is that each ability can be upgraded in varying ways.A character's attack for example can be modified to either deal splash damage or heal allies thus leading to two very different play styles with the same character.In addition the platforming elements require a level of manuevering that is rare in it's competitors.The only other clear strength this game has over other Mobas are the map varieties (of which I feel is still somewhat small regardless of their differences) in the sense that they all play differently enough that strategies are developed for specific ones.DLC skins while nice feel overpriced (I admit I am guilty of buying one) and lag remains a large issue due to the 'skill shots' and platforming elements of such a game. Some games can get away with such things however a game that is so reliant on reflexes requires a better connection.Bots are at best useless and at worst detrimental to your team as they often die to competent players easily enough, thus providing an almost laughably easy source of currency.If you plan on getting the most out of Awesomnauts play with either a reliable internet connection or at the very least with friends.Bottom like is that even if you dislike Mobas in general, Awesomenauts does things differently enough that even those who normally don't enjoy the genre might enjoy it, perhaps at a discount if nothing else.Those that enjoy Mobas would feel that this is a casual but fantastic experience and will find that's it's a great way to introduce newcomers to the genre.I'd reccomend this game rather strongly.\n",
      "So I got this after my friend told me to download it and play with him, our relationship will never be the same. After getting off this and purging my drive I went to use the toilet. It was a big one, and after good 2 solid minutes of pain trying to force this monster out I was done. After I wiped the sweat off my face and the dags off my hairy ♥♥♥ I stared at my creation for a very brief moment. And right there and then is when I realized that even tho this was a rather unpleasant experience (taking an arm sized ♥♥♥♥ that is) it was still a far better experience than trying this *cough* game.TLDR:Graphics like its 2003.Controls like a grampa with parkinsons.Next to no customization options in terms of gameplay controls, no crouch (so 2015) as an example.May have actually given me cancer...0/10 would not touch this with a 10-foot internet pole held by someone else.\n",
      "Under ConstructionWhen it works, it's such a fine game. Quite a small download being 2.5GB and takes up so little space for so much content. In the game, each type of advanced lifeform have their own language, I have met 4 so far and to effectively communicate with them, you will need to explore the planets in the system and find knowledge stones to learn the words of the language...(more later)---Past review---Don't buy it yet friends. Either doesn't start up and crashes or you'll lag even with a computer that's a lot better than the system requirements (refer to other reviews). Mine doesn't start at all with a GTX 1060 so wait unless it's all fixed. I've tried out a few fixes out there already and contacted HelloGames to no avail, I'll keep trying though. #RIPHARAMBE #FOREVERMISSEDI'll change this review later and keep ya'll updated.\n",
      "This is a really fun mmo, I've been playing it for a quite while now (before it had released on steam).It's especially fun if you have some friends to play it with. Even after you have unlocked every class there is still plenty to do and earn, such as wings, dragons, mounts, allies and much, much more!Be warned however, ever since the steam release trading can be particularly nasty.Finding specific items and their value can be hard sometimes and with the steam launch a large of mount of... well lets just say not very nice people started playing the game. A small part of the friendly community from post-steam launch is still there and a lot of friendly people joined after the steam launch, you just have to be wary of people trying to rip you off or make life hard for you. Those people are still a minority however and it's easy to play the game without ever meeting one of them.Trion worlds have really outdone themselves with Trove and I can't wait for the new class, The Lunar Lancer, to be released. (a long time ago I bought a pack for the game and after i finished getting all classes they added a non tardeable class coin to the stuff in the pack, and then gave everyone a free one, so yeah i really need some new classes to release to spend them on lol)\n",
      "T'was a wonderul day on the island of rusdore Where all the naked mens dongers swung wildly in delight, There was this one young fellow naked allahu He was a young one too, He had many friends and many c4 he had the biggest house on the island and an amazing statue of his father and his fathers father. One day, It was'nt just any day... It was the day the tourists flew over our wonderful island dropping ♥♥♥♥ on top of houses... Every naked man in the vicinity ran towards the luggage box and fought over it, Young allahu was worried, He really wanted the  2k15 New C4 smell C4 only 200 made in the country, So allahu As worried and scared from all the big men and their incredably hard spears He grabbed his dodgy but new looking Assault rifle and off he went, Dodging donger by donger he ran towards the crate he was 50 meters between c4 and allahu.... He had done it! I had the c4! Allahu couldn't believe his eyes and all the other peoples eyes as they teared in agony That night, While allahu was gazing at his new c4 Not knowing what was outside of his rather large Wooden mansion an army was forming... They were all geared with state of the art wooden spears and formed outside his house, The leader (John F Kennedy) Knocked on his door 3 times, Allahu shreeked and put his c4 in his panic room if all hell broke loose He peeked through the window seeing 30+ Naked men with spears forming a massive line at his door. He was scared so he ran, John knocked again Silence he called along his trusty pal with an out dated 2k11 C4 and planted it on the decaying door *BANG* Allahu heard the crowd storm into his house creating havoc and looting, Allahu cried clenching his c4 whilst he was wishing he was home, The crowd were done with the loot and house and were looking for him He shreeked as they began dismantling the Iron door Allahu forgot his assault rifle on his table, He was defense was weak they were in allahu chucked the c4 far into the crowd and ran... He ran as fast as he could until he got to the edge of the island and sat down in pain... All his hard work was gone... T'was a tough night for Allahu he couldnt believe what was happening... He had a thought about remaking his life... He shrugged and planted his two feet on the edge of the island.... He looked down. The waves smashing the rocks below...... Allahu jumped regretting that he ever liv......*WHACK* It was all over Allahu just turning 12 had jumped and died.... That day is now in Rusdores book of history.... And the Fangdangle tribe still thrives in this harsh land guarding the now out dated C4 The end\n",

      "Okay I'l just get this right out there, Dota 2 has one of the worst communities in all of gaming. The game itself is intricet and almost impossible to master. A 10/10 in gaming but 2/10 for everyone else you have to play with online. If you go this game alone it will be difficult, but if you have friends who are willing to play it then by all means. Let the gaping black hole that is Dota 2 take you into an adventure that You will regret entering, but love playing. Ai in this game is very good for the scaling player, having easy, medium, hard and unfair as your difficulties. Once you can beat unfair bots you are ready to play online.

      "Go for it, such a great game to play with friends. The game has a save function even for multiplayer, so don't worry about the fact that most games go for quite a long time, simply save, and return later with your friends. On top of that, the game can get a little weird and wonderful when you play a dead civilisation, and end up winning with it. Does Age of Empires let you play future egyptians with death robots? I think not.\n",

      "Look. I'm not going to say that this is the best Naval Warfare game out there. Nor am I going to say it's better than World of Warships, because I've never played it. But what I can tell you for certain is, that like all Free-To-Play games, there will be grinding, anger, censoring, tears, happiness and satisfaction.  As a new player, you'll launch the game for the first time, login and then sit on the port screen. You've got the 4 factions most games based on WW2 have; Britain, Germany, Japan and America. Along with two more possibly to be factions- France and China.You'll go into your first game as a tier one, do a few matches and get to tier two. This is where things start to define who you are and what you want to be in this game. For Japan and America you can choose to go down all lines - Cruiser, Battleship, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine or Destroyer. For UK - Destoryer, Battleship and Aircraft carrier.For Germany - Crusier, Submarine and Battleship.Choosing what to do here will determine what you do for quite some time or to the tier you want to get to. Playing this with friends is definelty a must have, however \"thanks\" to the devs, the party size is now a maximum of 3 - used to be 5. But you can still have more than enough fun with 2 of your mates. As there is with all F2P games, there is a premium currency. Gold. Gold can be gained several ways, ranging from winning 5v5 battles and being on the leaderboard to buying it. So it isn't just money used to get it. Along with that, the game gives users V.I.P battles, which gains bonus XP (Both Global and ship based) and Silver (Ingame currency).Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses. Germans have good accuracy while dealing lower damage. Japan are the tanks of the ocean while America is the all-rounder. Britain has the best sonar and great AA defence.After a while, you'll notice that the game isn't perfect however. There are bugs here and there. Matchmaking issues in higher tiers where few dare to venture. Then you have the censorship which censors words like system. Although some sound game breaking, they really aren't. When players get to higher tiers, there goes the problem of bad balance in late tier games. Every game has their problems and none are perfect. And this game isn't an exception.A very good sign of a game like this is, although 1 year old in the Chinese market, the developers are active and from what has been said in many of the disucssion threads has been carefully and sufficiently thought out and replied to via their community officials. The game itself rewards players who are loyal -with regular login rewards- and those who play a battle correctly. It punishes those who make the wrong decision, however there are tutorials to start new players off.Finally the graphics of the game; they're not what you'd call amazing but they run well and the gameplay is more than worth having a slightly less 'pretty' game.TL:DR;WW2 factions, which are good at things and have boats. Team up with 3 people and wreck stuff! F2P game, so expect there to be premium vehicles such as the Tirpitz (Worth around $70). Game isn't perfect but hey, who/what is? Has active devs who care about the game but don't know how to promote the product so low playerbase... Rewarding game for players and harsh for stupidity. Ok graphics. Not the best but it runs.\n",
      "Empire Total War... Where to begin. This game is one of my favourite from the Total War franchise due to being set in the 1800's which is really awesome as it allows you to play around and change the fate of the world. The stock game comes with a large amount of content which allows for quite an emersive experience from charging cavalry into the rear of a battalion of line infantry to firing a full broadside from the HMS Victory into a pirate vessel. This Real Time Strategy allows for so much and has the potential to look so beautiful on high graphics, it makes you feel like you are acctually in the game (well not really, but it still feels really good). Along with the DLC packages you get even more to think about like how much you want to spend to create one of the many special units or how to make a strategic army of native Americans. The AI is quite smart, it will try to flank you and will fall back and stay there (depending on the difficulty)if you have a really powerful large force but this game is best to play with friends against other people. The multiplayer (aswell as the singleplayer) has a large amount of maps and settings for weather and times (both period and day), and allows for up to 4v4 which can lead up to really epic battles on large preportions.This game is very good, some would say otherwise but in my opinion it is great and hope it is for you too.\n",
      "They took a step forward, bringing in better optimisation for lower and higher end builds, a graphical overhaul, and a new and powerfully immersive ui, but they took a step back from the mod by removing all shotguns, all but one assualt rifle, all snipers rifles and all but one pistol. I know its an alpher but seriously? Removing key weapons that made the mod so unique essentially takes this game a step back in time. Don't even bother playing with friends who have just bought the game btw. Since the game doesn't tell you where you spawn, it can take you literally 30+ minutes to meet up with said friends. This game is not worth $30 and it feels like they took a step forward, an then half a step backwards. Alpha stage of the game feels rushed to meet the pre-christmas deadline. 6/10 get rust instead/.\n",
      "Been playing Wildstar since launch back in 2014.Despite its rocky start during launch, Carbine has particularly fixed the bugs and updated the systems for wildstar, creating a UI that is far more friendly. Their constant drive and enthuasim in delivering new content has certainly boosted it's enjoyability, and i would totally recommend this game to anyone who loves a good fun mmorpg that is contantly evolving.Pros- Availability of equipment and no pay walls that limit you from reaching your full potential-Balanced class system, with ability to customize your prefered class to your tailored play style. -Strong visual style, that emphasizes on a toony but appealing aesthetic.-Amazing housing customization tools, allows for players to create the home of their dreams with presets or if your the adventurous type, personal custom house building. Release your inner architect!-Fast paced, reactive combat gameplay, that plays to the games style and strengths-Great community and development team-Consitant and Freqeunt great new content.-Interesting locations and dungeon narrative.-The humor is great and the game devs love to play on pop culture references.Cons- PvP times fluctuate based on population present.- Faction population inbalanced at this time.- Crafting vocations vary in usefulness.- There is no cow level....Yet.\n",

Telling them about the wonderful yet delapidated undersea city called Rapture, the megalomaniacal Andrew Ryan; creator of the city, the highly addicted (injectible) drugs that give you superpowers is a joy. However it continues, as you must talk about the addicted Splicers, the Big Daddies, the Little sisters, the numerous other characters you meet on your journey who have been affected by rapture differentley, the wonderful locations that are both interesting and dangerous.

      "*Take this review with a grain of salt*Before I go through this review, please note that this game is not for everyone. Alright, let's begin.StoryThe story was somewhat predictable, yet still good. It revolves around the main protagonist (Neptune), who has lost her memory and slowly brings the main cast together who at first hate each other, but later on become friends. They then band together to fight an evil person thretening to destroy the world. Relatively cliche.One thing you'll pick up straightaway is the reference to other games and anime. Oh god the references. Also there's fanservice. GameplayThe gameplay, in my opinion was solid. You don't need to excessively grind, so long as you know what you're doing and not avoid every monster. Strategic placement of your characters is a necessity for victory in the later stages. Great thing is, exp is shared with your entire party. For example, if you gain 5000 exp from a battle, EVERYONE gets 5000 exp, unlike some games which only give the most based on who does what. This significantly speeds up the levelling process. There is also the remake system which I'll go into further detail after.Remake systemAlright, so basically when this game got remade from the original, they changed the storyline up a little and added this new feature called the REMAKE SYSTEM. Basicaly, what it allows you to do is add new dungeons, enemies for those dungeons, you can change the item pick ups, make new accessories and just create a load of stuff. Great addition to add variety to the game.New Game+One important feature of this game is NEW GAME+. Once you've finished the game, you can redo the game again and go for a second cycle. This is necessary to get all the added CPU candidates which you can create via the remake system. The good thing is, all your credits, experience, levels and items get rolled over, so you cna go for the achievements that you may have missed in the first run. The bad thing is that enemies dont get stronger at all, so if you're a high enough level, you have no challenge at all (aside from the colosseum).DLCPlease note that DLC is not necessary to get all achievements, so its not a forced buy.The DLC allows you to unlock 3 new characters:-Histiore-Peachy-PlutiaAnd the additional packs give you 300 levels per pack and added dungeons and colosseum battles, so you can go back and have more fun.All in all, you get 3 characters, 900 additional levels and new dungeons if you decide to purchase every DLC.So to sum upIf you're an anime fan, like loli protagonists and have some money to throw at a screen, this is the game for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth the money and time that I invested in it and I don't regret one bit of it.Pros:+Remake system+No endless grinding+Lots of characters+Good variety+Good gameplay+Fanservice+Nice variety of personalities+Good parodies+Great soundtrackCons:-Story lacks twists and can be cliche at times-Character voices can sometimes be irritating to listen to-Hard boss fights if you dont grind levels at early stages-Difficulty curve on some parts are too extreme9.5/10Once again, it is not for everyone, but I highly recommend this game. Also, this is much better than the original so don't bother trying the original and go straight for the remake.\n",
      "right payday 2 is a fantastic fun 4 player shooter. you will spend most of your time playing with your friends shooting cops, but some times without friends it can be hard and you will find before your about to type a message in the talk bar, they have already done the thing you were going to tell them not to, this can be frustraighting on stealth missions. it can also be hard if your a high level and the people you are playing with are low and have no idea what there doing. if you talk before the game starts in the chat bar, you have a much better chance of getting the job done easyer. the other option is playing single player with AI, which was no fun at all, the AI team mates are so stupid they just run around in plain sight letting every one know there the're and ruining it for you. playing with friends, talking over steam chat or skype however is one of the best and funneist game times ive had over the years, i couldnt stop myself from laughing. so the bottom line is if your going to get this game, make sure your friends get it as well and you will ave a blast.\n",
      "fantastic, great fun, with or without friends. but everything is much funner with friends. get it is so adictive the weapon customisation is endless and ITS FREE!!!!!!\n",
      "Overall, the game is great. However, the developers seem to have forgotten about the game soon after the release. Glitches and bugs reported just after the release haven't been fixed yet and will not be. Furthermore, the game in multiplayer co-op mode is painful to play because every once in a while there is some glitch corrupting the saves (probably a desync between host and a second player) - a problem that hasn't been addressed from the day one. Shame really,  the game is great in single player but if you wish to play the campaign with your friend you may have a hard time with reloading save from 20 turns before in order to fix an issue. BTW: for some reason reviewing the DLC - Fall of the Samurai is unfeasible, and one thing worth noting is that the base game is much less glitchy and buggy as the expansion is.\n",
      "Successfully ruined my life. 10/10Edit : But in all honesty this is a great game, I recommend it to all my friends... Just make sure your rig can handle it\n",
      "Shot cameras, ran out of ammo, killed cops, revived friends, died (countless times)10/10.\n",
      "This game is very good for just playing solo and with a bunch of friends. In most multiplayer games there are people that are toxic or just try to make your day bad, in CS:GO, this only rarely happens.BUY THIS GAME IF U ARE LOOKING FOR:- Good FPS shooter- Competitive gaming for each skill level- Nice community- A game to play with friends or by yourself- Hackers get banned easily, little to no hackers \n",

      "What can I say? Payday was a solid staple game for my friends for about 5-6 years. We all preordered the criminal career edition, and had a blast. I even stuck through it when a bug deleted my entire save af about 3-6 months work. Now, ♥♥♥♥ it. It even isn't worth it on a free weekend. Reddit had made jokes ironically about us becoming the next TF2, or the next CS:GO, and now that it's here, I think it was the final straw. This has made me incredibly sad, to see one of the game studio's I admire to sink so low.For those out of the loop, anfd want a basic overview of why there is so much outrage, Overkill have ♥♥♥♥ed the weapons up to make shotguns more than twice as weak as pistols, and added skins you get from 'safes' which you open with 'drills' for 2.49, that give stat boosts.{Edit}Figured I'd edit this review now, especially given whats happened. Now, drills and safes are free. Now that everything is attainable without spending money outside of DLC, I feel like I can recommend this game again.\n",
      "I watched the animated series so it made the game even more enjoyable. This game is great fun with friends but you can also have a pretty good time alone cause you'll more than likely run into other lovers of the series which mean you can chat about your favourite moments or favourite episodes with them. Anyway highly reccomend this game is just so much fun and some of the quotes made are funny.\n",
      "Awesome Game so far, I managed to run it on Intel HD 4600 integrated graphics with my i5 4460 CPU and I could run it on normal at 25fps, still looks awesome. Story Mode is enthralling, even though I have played it before on Xbox. So much to do, it never gets boring unless you have an unimaginative mind, no friends or you are playing it 24/7. Only thing that sucks is hackers setting you on fire as soon as you spawn, taking away weapons and blowing up your awesome cars and making you pay insurance prices. Overall, awesome game! 9/10 IGN - Much use of 'awesome', many sighs.\n",
      "Its free, and is fun with friends (with mics)\n",
      "As someone who is lukewarm to online deathmatch (but massively enjoyed deathmatch in Q3A, PREY and COD4), as far as I'm concerned, THIS game has killed classic-style deathmatch shooters. It's insanely fun and suits a LOT of gameplay approaches (including hanging at the back and offering more passive support if you're not too good with a gun).For some reason, the people it attracts are a LOT friendlier than in other deathmatch games, even on enemy teams- my server frequently enables 'all talk' so we can chat.The classes are surprisingly well balanced, and that's despite the fact they don't actually NEED to be as their main job is to serve different jobs (which are fun). Although just as fun, you don't NEED them if you know how to organize yourselves (me and some friends decided to attack an enemy base entirely as scouts).The alt weapons are actually nicely balanced. Instead of being merely 'better' than the regular weapons, they simply fit a specific style of gameplay (the best are actually earned through achievements). For example, alt rocket launchers are better than the standard version in some areas, but worse in others- and thus are, in effect, actually equal.\n",
      "Those who loves RPG, dungeons, getting rare loots, building your own house, playing with your friends in your guild(they call it CLUB in the game) this is the perfect game for you.\n",

      "On the surface, it's easy to understand why so many people are ready to dismiss Starbound as nothing more than a Terraria clone in space. I was skeptical before I took the plunge for video and review work, and after a lengthy weekend session, I'm willing to claim that Starbound has so much more to offer.The basic quest system is great, giving you some guidance into the early crafting recipies and how to actually play the game. If you aren't into that, it's all good friends, You can just head off and explore the galaxy, alone or with friends.It's Early Access, so patches are coming hard and fast, and yes, you may lose your progress (it's happened twice for me thus far), however it's so exciting to be part of such a orust community. If you're looking for an adventure and you have some friends who are willing to play with you, go ahead and purchase the game right now!\n",
      "Really enjoyable game, especially with your friends. Feels like terraria and maplestory combined with the play style and the skills. Minor bugs which I'm sure the devs will resolve sooner than later, other than that would recommend buying. 4/5\n",
      "This was a great game when it first started out but as of late you can buy op heros for massive amounts of money that are nessarsary. This game is really hard without payed heros nomatter howmany friends you have although it is beatable and you have to reaply leves more than you should. It can still be fun though by playing an couple of hours regularly.Over all realy good for free to play. 6/10Dowload it but its not for everyone.\n",
      "Needs a bit of work and is overpriced but is still a hell of lot of fun, get it while its on sale and bring friends\n",

      "For everyone who downloaded this game I suggest you to buy the Gold Upgrade if you have friends to play with and if you play this game a lot so yea but I still suggest to play this game it is amazing\n",
      "I suggest people to buy and play this game but if you have friends to play if you are alone and don't have anyone to play with buy it when they have it or if you have a friend that has it. But at the end I do suggest you to buy this game it is a great game with a good story.\n",
      "Pay day 2 is a very interesting game with many elements to it and having many updates and frequent updates makes the game still living and still alive for everyone I do suggest to buy it if you have friends you can play with since this game depends mostly on friends if you want real fun but overall it is a fun game\n",
      "Must buy if you have friends it may seem boring but it is a very fun game!\n",
      "Amazing game to play with friends.\n",
      "100 hours in and I want more! I can move through maps maps like I'm flying and rack up the kills, what more do you want. An easy map editor that you can use to build maps with friends too, well theres that :P.Its a seriously deep game where you can find action quick with only 10 minutes duals unlike other big fps games that take an hour for a game.   Reflex also allows for you to edit how the game looks like how you want, no creative lock that the devs force onto you. Right now don't display the gun models but have the colour of my crosshair showing what gun I have which is nice.10/10 will play again!\n",
      "Hace 3 años que salió el juego y lo compré, y siguen si hacer avances significativos, nunca pasó a beta el juego.Es cierto, disfrute mucho jugando este juego, pero sufriendo con muchísimos bugs. Parece que a los desarrolladores les importa un carajo el juego, solo juntaron la guita y dejaron de sacar actualizaciones seguidas. Cada 3 meses con suerte llega una actualización, que solamente trae items de ♥♥♥♥♥♥ y un par de boludeces, pero siguen sin optimizar el juego, no es normal tener un I5, 8 GB de RAM, buena placa de video y tener que jugar el juego con gráficos bajos.Al que le sobre la plata y le chupe los dos huevos gastarla, que se compre el juego, pero el que tiene dudas, no lo haga.Hasta que los desarrolladores no se pongan las pilas, no recomiendo este juego.\n",
      "Played it for about an hour, I've found I'm dying for one thing, MULTIPLAYER PLEASE DEVELOPERS. The exploration feature in would be on par with Minecraft if multiplayer was added. If the AI was increased and some more horrific creatures were added this game would already have a 9/10 from me. I'm keeping in mind this is an Early Access game.Wishes + Things I like:- If it had an edge of fear from larger and more variant fish types.- Some nasty marine life at night. As in nocturnal life. - Multiplayer. It would increase my hours of gameplay phenominally not to mention all my friends hours who would play this with me.- The concept and room for ideas in this is great.Cons:- It seems a little empty and I wish the graphics options were a bit more diverse. I cant turn up the render distance and its a little odd to suddenly see life spawning in front of me.  - Going in and out of bases seems little too instant and takes me out of the game quite harshly. - Switching between weapons has a bit more effort than necessary, making it scroll-able would be a great time saver instead of having to pause and go to your inventory screen and change numbers around. \n",
      "Hardcore Shooter, best played with friends or with large ingame groups. It does take some time to unlock weapons and attachments so only for the patient. ALL weapons and attachments can be unlocked without paying real money. cosmetic upgrades require real money. Requires a strong PC to run.\n",
      "This game is the best! Up to 7000 troops/ships, many countries to choose from, lots of upgrades and so much fun with friends :D. MUST HAVE.\n",
      "Lots of negative reviews for the full release, at least they are still releasing patches for it, no game breaking bugs. Very fun to play with friends, fun combat and building. Definitely give it a try!\n",
      "You might play it for 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day. But you wont play this like its your job the game is good with friends but could be boring alone with annoying servers, but the game is good over all.\n",
      "I recommend that you download this game because it is a very addicting game and it has a variety of weapons ,DLCs and character customizations .I also enjoy this game because you get to play with your friends and it gets hard and extremely epic when people join .\n",
      "is fun beacuase play with friends\n",
      "Even though it's an old teamwork-oriented game, it still is so much fun to play on and has so many things to do; never gets boring if you have 2-3 friends to play together in versus games. Also, the custom campaigns from the workshop add a boost of entertaining and the scavenge on the rooftop from No Mercy map is very awesome. The plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way. I spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it, that's why i highly suggest everyone who's interested in good content should try this.It has its ups and downs. You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.In conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!\n",
      "It's a nice survival and crafting game for a definitely good price. Sometimes becomes repetitive when you begin a new world, but a lot of fun with friends! Also, the fact that is very hard to survive the winter season even with the thermal stone in your inventory (which decreases its temperature fast) and the deerclops attacking you make this game challenging!\n",
      "Honestly, As somebody who thought that cod has been the same thing over and over well before black ops 2, I laughed at another COD however i played this game at my friends house and I instantly became hooked. Yea there may be fps problems but Bo3 is a breathe for fresh air for the cod genre. The weapons are pretty balenced and the perks too. This is a game that i find you can play for hours on end, and not have that typical bad cod taste. I strongly reccomend this game. For all New COD and Seasoned players. Rate 8.5/10\n",
      "This game is extremely fun but theres an error called ControllableLocalPlayer and i cant join my friends :( plz help me plz. My skype: ken.ta24 plz help me\n",
      "I find this game really fun, mostly because i love simulator games. But i love this game especially because of the weather, events, challenges, and i cant play it (because i have no friends) but there is a multiplayer mode as well, you can also create your own route for singleplayer, friends and global players, as well as play other peoples routes (obviously). you dont have to, but i like to play with a ps4 controller, as it makes things a lot easier. But overall i give this game an 8/10 (oh, and by the way, im not very good with spelling or grammer as i am only 15 years old)\n",
      "a great game to play with friends when bored :3\n",
      "Lured naked man into my house and trapped him in a empty room, when he was hungry i fed him raw chicken I got from another naked man I killed after seeing him kill a deer and get chicken from it, later his friends tried to save him and i killed them all and then he died of food poisoning. 100,000/10\n",
      "A great game with sometimes the funniest games you will ever play. This game has a element of skill that is required but be warned it is not new gamer friendly. Give it some time and you will soon get the hang of it. Watch some helpful guides in the steam community as this will thorougly give you a run down on what to expect or to be expected of.\n",
      "After an Hour and a Half of playing I can already see the major con of this game. The lack of communication. I don't know what it is but I feel like I am the only one communicating with the team. This is really frustrating and can lead to failure. I feel that the lack of it removes from the immersion, which this game with it's fantastic lighting and level design, has. It is a great looking game, with some of the best lighting I've seen in a game since I first played Interstellar Marines. If you have friends to play this game on a team with, I highly recommend it. If you can cope with the lack of communication, it's still worth a pickup. Otherwise, it will only be fun for a few hours. If I can persuade some of my friends to buy this game then I will get it, otherwise I will rush to get this game.\n",
      "Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is a fantastic game! Don't let my playtime mislead you, I have played this game on the Xbox 360 aswell, and my oh my is this game fun. It's unique style of gameplay really makes for a great experience. And in such a game like this the soundtrack is brilliant. I love it, the music is so important in this game and it none less than excels too. I would recommend this to all people, if you like stealth or don't, if you prefer Co-Op games or play alone, to people I've met on the street or my mother (who only plays Candy Crush - on an iPhone, might I ad), or even my girlfriend's brother who said - and meant it - that \"The only reason he gets every game on xbox is because the graphics are so much better on console than PC.\"9/10 - For Casual Gamers, Hardcore Gamers, and everyone inbetween. This game really is a treat for all\n",
      "Modern Warfare 2, the 6th installment in the Call of Duty series, is a phenominon. This is a game I still enjoy 5 years after it's release! The campaign is brilliant and much fun. The \"No Russian\" mission is still a great one in my opinion. Not many games dare to go where Infinity Ward did with that mission. And they managed to pass it off successfully. Showing off the sheer brutality of Makarov and his crew. Now it isn't as graphically appealing as such games like Battlefield 3, but it is great for a CoD game. This is when the graphics of CoD was at it's finest. And nowadays, not to beat around the bush, but... CoD is now the most ♥♥♥♥ franchise in existence. I hate it. The only reason I bought MW2 was for how much fun it was and how much it brought to the table for FPS games.  It still manages to be enjoyable and so much fun. Spec-Ops is brillaint with a friend. Hours on end went into Spec-Ops splitscreen on my Xbox 360.Overall, I would only recommend this game now to people that still enjoy this game and are willing to pay this amount of money for a few hundred online players, the campaign (which nearly everyone has played before) and the Spec-Ops. 8/10\n",
      "Alien Isolation is incredible. A marvel for any fan of the series. I have played this game for 5 hours now. I have jumped countless times. I bought this over The Evil Within because I felt my loyalty to the series would be broken if I didn't get this. And thank god my loyalty ruled. I also hate myself. The alien is %98 unscripted. That 2% is set actions (which are still scary). That 98% is actions which nobody could predict. The Xeno is terrifying and overall amazing. It looks amazing, the attention to detail is brilliant. The Animations are so life-like! And the AI. Don't even get me started on the AI. I have never seen such inteligent AI in a horror game before. The Xenomorph is the most perfect predator in this game. The best time I had in this game was on the first Survivor Mode mission. I was on skype with my friend and he thought it would be funny to watch me get all worked up over a scary game, So I chose Isolation. The first mission, on my way out of the first room I was checking my tracker frantically. Suddenly I hear a beeping, I check my tracker, to the left of me there is the xenomorph charging me so - like us men do - panicked and pulled out my flamethrower so the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would retreat! I quickly sprinted to the stairs as the Xeno ran way into the vents. I heard more beeping as I hit the first platform on the stairs. I also hear movement in the vents above me. I check my tracker, nothing in all directions. I turn round slowly and there it is. The black body of a Xenomorph rushing me from less than 4m away. I screamed loudly, sharply and for a long time. As at the same time I threw my mouse onto my monitor as I had a little spastic fit. My mate was in hysterics and I was sweating like crazy. I of course starting laughing like some sort of sociopath and pulled my mic back as i watched myself get spliced through the head on my screen. The times I have had in these 4 hours of gameplay were great. Bare in mind, this campaign is long. Really long. I'm making it longer because I suck at horror games but am great at films, so I'm only on mission 4 still. There's that. Overall, this is the scariest game I have played. And I've played lots of scary games as an adrenaline junkie with a taste for fear . I would recommend this to any gamer who loves horror films and/or games. Even if they hadn't seen the original Alien film.10/10 - An Absolute for everyone's gaming library!\n",
      "Better than CoD. Mind you, these days what isn't? But still, in the short time I've played this I know this is one of the golden age shooters like Quake or Unreal. Two of my favourite games from the golden age of gaming (as such with wolfenstein: because who doesn't like killing a mechatronic Nazi boss?) and this is definitely added to that list! This is one of the few games as to why I should have gotten a PC when I was younger instead of only recently getting into it. Sure, I played games like this with my mates on their PC (which is where i played Quake and Unreal) but I would have loved to play this every day when I younger. You don't just \"Run in guns a blazin'\" or any of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You do that and \"It's game over, man! Game over!\" Enter with a plan, go slow, and attack.Oh, and a heads up for the marine campaign: If you have a weak heart then don't play it. I don't have one at all, I jumped more than in most modern - crappy - horrors. This campaign is terrorfiying and suspensful. Stay on your toes, soldier, and watch your tracker!11/10 - Would reccomend to all friends and strangers on the street! Even those that aren't gamers, or don't even have a PC!\n",
      "This game is another reason why the Hitman Series defines the stealth genre. This and Blood Money may well be the two best stealth games I have ever played, in the list with Manhunt 2 and Splinter Cell: Conviction. The mechanics displayed in this game are marvellous and the graphics are exceptionally beautiful, the immersion from the voice acting and graphics is at it's upmost peak when you're escaping a heavily armed chopper on Chicago rooftops or exploring the vast area of Dexter Industries. I have never been so amazed by such a game, and hopefully this will be a benchmark for an expansive list of games, in the stealth genre, to come. 10/10 - Would reccomend to every friend!\n",
      "In the 2-odd-hours I've had this game, I have been a bike getting chased by a raging 12 year old with an SMG, I've used my physics gun to play TITANFALL Volleyball, and I have been scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from hormonal teenagers with zombie skins in Zombie Survival. If this isn't enough to make you buy this game for yourself and every friend you've ever known, then obviously you're no gamer at all.\n",
      "Chivalry is the kind of game that is fairly easy to jump into, but has a lot more to it than you'd think.First, I'll just describe it for you and then I'll share my thoughts on the game:It's essentially a online multiplayer-only FPS with swords instead of guns. It's a class-based game, with 4 classes to choose from. There are various gamemodes which you'll recognise if you've ever played games like TF2 or COD before. There's team objective mode, free-for-all, team deathmatch and last team standing modes, among others. Team Objective mode plays similarly to the payload or capture-the-point modes in TF2 in the sense that you run forward from your spawn, complete objective A, then your spawn moves forward, then you do objective B, etc.Servers generally have a player limit of 32 players, 16 to each team, and the playerbase is quite large so you'll never have problems finding a server to join. There are plenty of \"low-level\" servers as well if you want a more noob-friendly place to play.The actual mechanics are very straightforward. Fights consist of hacking and slashing at your enemy, parrying/blocking his attacks and trying not to die first. Or you can be an archer and pick them off from a distance. You can discover all the basic combat mechanics within a couple hours of playing because of how simple it is.Let me just say this right now: you WILL die a lot at first and you will probably want to give up. There are players who have played for thousands of hours who will kill you over and over, leaving you frusrated and ready to ragequit.Chivalry is the kind of game you can sink hours and hours into but never really \"master\". The mechanics are simple, yes, but it takes a lot of time to understand how to play well. There are only a few different types of attacks and the weapons all have the same basic mechanics to them, but it takes a lot of time to get a feel for when to start an attack, when to hold back, when to parry, etc. If you push through it, the game becomes very enjoyable.I hope that gives you a basic idea of what the game is about. Now I'll put some of my own thoughts out:As of writing this, I have played over 1000 hours over a span about a year and a half, and I don't regret it at all. It's one of the only games I don't think I will ever truly stop playing. The community is great, the combat never really gets old, and even after all this time I can't say I've gotten sick of it.I can't say the game is 100% perfect though. The fact that the mechanics are so basic means that fighting higher-level players often boils down to who knows the most exploits. Any swing of a weapon can be parried to do no damage at all, and once you know how to parry the only way you can be hit is by luck, or you somehow screw it up, or the other persons feints to trick you into parrying early, but you can even learn to spot when someone is going to feint, so fighting can just end up swing, parry, swing, parry, swing, parry, etc, until one person slips up. This kind of combat doesn't rely on skill, it relies on one person misclicking and screwing up.But that being said, even after >1000 hours of play-time I can't say I've really mastered the game. There are heaps of little tricks that people use to break away from the boring \"swing, parry, swing, parry\" combat which I'll probably never get the hang of, and it keeps me on edge whenever I'm playing.So would I reccommend this game? Definitely. For all the hours I've spent (and enjoyed), It was definitely worth the ~$5 I paid for it when it was on sale one weekend. I'd probably have paid $50 or so if I'd known how good it was. Look up some videos on the internet of the kind of hijinks you get can up to and you'll see what I mean by how much fun you can have in this game.\n",
      "I'm not a big Don't Starve fan, but when I got to play Co-op/Online with my friend I had to much fun, It was awesome. -Easy to set-up servers too play with friends.-No Lag-Easy to no your way around-All around awesome game.8/10. Must Get\n",
      "I have played this game for many hours, I have had a lot of fun doing so. I'm new too the Counter Strike games. I have played CS:S for about 60 hours. But only really played deathruns. When I first got CSGO I wasn't a big fan (Got it when they didn't have skins added in) I got back in too it because I had started playing CS:S and I wanted to move up to the next best thing. I wanted to play Deathruns and all them types of game modes in CSGO, but I saw that they had a Comp game mode. I started to play that, now I just can't stop playing this game. I love it.Positives:+All around fun game+Lot of guns with-in the game+Lot of skins to be unboxed or to buy+Awesome team based game (Comp)+Helped with my talking skills+Good game to make new friends+A very nice looking gameNegative- A lot of 12 year olds- Hard to rank up in comp- Can lose a lot of money (Real Money)-9/10 MEMES\n",
      "Um ótimo simulador de friendzone !\n",
      "I can safely say I have never been into sports games like FIFA or car racing games, and when my friend showed me this game I honestly didn't think I would enjoy it, however... It is freaking amazing fun!!Grab a team of mates together on steam chat or skype and have a \"blast\" using rocket propelled cars to smash an over sized soccer ball across a colourful field into your opponent's goal box and maybe blow someone up along the way in a 4 vs 4 show down! With awesome customisation of vehicle bodies and exhaust effects this game has all the razzle dazzle you could ask for with speed to match.I can safely recommend this game to people, even those like me who are not into sports games. Buckle up fasten your hats and have a blast!\n",
      "Probably one of the better dlcs out there, not worth the $7 price tag, I would price it at $5. Adds a very fun heist and the tazer, would buy this for friends\n",
      "A game that immerse the player in a heist where they must complete certain missions in different maps with a vibrant atmosphere. Monaco is a fun game that allows you to work together with your friends or play solo. Definitely a must play and recommendws to all.\n",
      "A friend of mine recommend me this game (you know who you are,i beat you on dota2 1v1 match)\n",
      "Really fun and addictive fps zombie killing game.Fun with friends play alone and suffer.Overall its an awesome game :Hands:\n",
      "Planetside 2 is the perfect example of free to play done right.Its expansive content, intense battles, beautiful environments and appealing UI make planetside a great game to play solo or with friends. The free to play model is very well ballanced. The starter weapons feel great to use and very effective. with upgrades and new weapons priced fairly low, it doesnt take long to get that cool looking camo or sniper rifle you've been after. Weapons and vehicles feel balanced, as everything having its pros and cons. The world of planetside has 3 factions struggling for control over 3 massive continents. Battles never get repetetive with a huge variety of bases to capture/defend and limitless ways to do so. The games visuals are a stunning mix between sci-fi and natural environments. The game is very well optimised, allowing PCs of all strengths to run smoothly. Team play isn't forced upon you but sticking together with friends or randoms has its advantages and fun is ensured. Overall, planetside is a great free to play game and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "TLDR - I highly recommend this product to anyone who has an interest in the videogame development process and/or the indie scene. I give Super Game Jam an 8/10.Episode 1 - NavigatorI was interested in this project since launch. The only reason I didn't buy in earlier was the mixed opinions I have been seeing here and there. Some saying the project doesn't live up to expectations and other saying it goes above and beyond them. After a long time and many moments of \"I'm going to buy this now\" and then \"On second thought I will wait\", I finally bought Super Game Jam. I watched the first episode and played the first game I am very happy so far. The documentary portion was great. I really liked the personalities involved (Richard Boeser – dev of Ibb and Obb and Jan Willem Nijman - 50% of Vlambeer) and felt they had good chemistry, it was interesting, not as personal as I would have liked (Indie Game: The Movie nailed it), Sound and music were great aside from some bumping around in the background and the cinematography was up there with the likes of 'Free to Play' and 'Indie Game: The Movie'. The game that I watched these two guys make in 48 hours was really cool. The control were tight, visuals enthralling and I really loved the concept and I'm glad Nijman pushed the racing + companionship idea so hard. Overall, I found watching the back and forth, creative process between these two devs who had never worked together before to be really fun and even inspiring especially after playing the game and seeing just how much they accomplished in 48 hours. For this review, I don't think I can give it a numbered score but I will say that I enjoyed the first episode immensely and would recommend it. I cannot wait to watch and play the rest of this (I cannot think of a word to describe this other than the very broad term of 'Project').Episode 2 - BlossomThe Documentary The second episode started off with something I wasn't expecting. The two new devs (Dominik Johann – former dev of Might and Delight and Christoffer Hedborg – Artist and dev for Super Stress-Out) sat down and watched a video message from the previous two devs whom gave the new duo their theme to work with. I really like this idea of passing on ideas from game jam to game jam, dev to dev. After receiving the message the two developers brainstormed the theme, which was gardening. The brainstorm sessions that occurred in the first episode as well are great. They give a cool look into how a game is conceived. I don't want to give a recap of the whole episode so I will just point out a few likes and dislikes I had with this episode. Much like the first, this episode had two devs with great creative chemistry, wonderful cinematography (especially those creative/scenic transitions/montages), music and flow. This episode did a great job at showing the stress and uncertainty that the two underwent during the final hours of the jam that wasn't all that present in the first episode. The only downside to this episode has to be, how hard it was to follow the creative process. I could barely understand what the game was shaping into until the end of the episode. This is probably the way the devs felt as well but I still felt pretty lost at times. This episode was certainly good but missed a major element that kept me engaged throughout the first.The GameThe game was a little more abstract and harder to understand than the first. What I got from it was that it is about survival in an endless space with a home planet that is destined to die. The art, music, sound design, gravity and steering of the home planet were all stellar but the goal of the game was hard to comprehend. Even without a concrete goal, the game was still enjoyable enough to play through numerous times.OverallThe second part of this project was good, not as good as the first but nonetheless very enjoyable. I can't wait to watch and play the next Episode of Super Game Jam.Episode 3 - Catch of DeathThe DocumentaryLet me start off by saying this is by far my favourite episode of this project so far. What made this episode and contributed to the greatness of the first 2 is the amazing chemistry between the 2 devs chosen. I cannot give them enough praise for their choice of devs. These two guys, Sos Sosowski and Adam Drucker are ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. They are the perfect match. They both have very comical personalities that had me laughing aloud very often. This episode was filled with comedy and I'm very glad the project makers noticed this and focused on this. Along with the hilarity, this episode also had the same wonderful overarching features that previous eps had (e.g. Music, cinematography), a great brainstorm segment, very memorable quotes from both devs and a nice change of tone for the entire project. This episode felt crazy, hilarious and gloriously ragtag. These guys seemed like the best of friends from start to finish and their ridiculous ideas, funny communications and strange workflow made this episode extremely enjoyable.The GameThe game is as ludicrous as the devs behind it. It is basically football without rules or reason. A ♥♥♥♥fest of button spam and desperately trying to find where my character is and who my character is among a variety of other deranged characters in a world built by a 4 year old wielding nothing but a box of crayons and the kitchen wall. It's incredibly hard to understand what is going on but I had so much fun with this game. My playtime was also vastly extended by the inclusion of all the builds leading up to the final working game. Broken but fun.OverallThis episode is beyond amazing. Enough said.Episode 4 - TorrThe DocumentaryThis episode featured a dev who I was really looking forward to seeing. Jonatan Soderstrom, who made Hotline Miami, one of my favourite games. Jonatan was accompanied by Martin Jonasson, who made Rymdkapsel. This developer duo did not have the chemistry that previous duos had. Even though Martin was upbeat and happy most of the time, Jonatan looked uncomfortable and bored most of the time and was very quiet for the better part of the episode. I'm not saying I don't like him or disrespect him because he seemed bored but it did have an impact on how much I enjoyed this episode. Another factor that I missed was the creative brainstorming at the start of each episode. There didn't seem to be much a brainstorm and that kind of disappointed me as these creative session have been super interesting in past episodes. Flaws aside this episode featured the best cinematography so far. The use of Bokeh in a lot of shots made for some beautiful scenery and cool interview sets. The music in this episode was also some of my favourite from the project. Finally I found the creative process really easy to follow even without the brainstorm at the beginning. I understood every decision they made and why because the devs explained what they were doing as they went forward. This episode was a bit of a letdown but the expertise in cinematography and the still enjoyable premise of the project made it fun to watch anyway.The GameReview coming soon...\n",

      "This game is heaps of fun, but i cannot recommend it due to the fact that there is no grouping system for playing with your friends, the only way is to constantly join and leave lobbys until you find your friend. which means that games take forever to start from people leaving all the time.i would highly recommend this game if they can fix this with a grouping system.\n",

      "Zombie Army Trilogy is a major upgrade when dealing with the zombie onslaughts, with a matrix-styled slow motion, you can really get a deep satisfaction from a headshot. Granted the visuals are outstanding and I can not wait until my friends join me seeing that while enjoying a game solo is made so much better when it is a shared experience. The game gives you a wide variety of weapons to use against the zombies and of course like in shaun of the dead you can melee by kicking the snot of them.  It would be great if the score was displayed so that bragging rights to the most kills would be easily shown but in my experience playing the campaign so far upon death is when you see how many you kill. You may be surprised at how bloodthirsty you get whilst playing this game!What are waiting for? Get this game and hunt some zombies\n",

      "If you enjoyed the likes of Minecraft, Terraria, Dont Stave and the plethora of in-degvelopment/early access sandbox titles stop reading reviews and buy this game!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That beign said I'll do my best to pull out what it is that makes this one of my all time favorite games. This review will be updated as the Beta progresses. You are an explorer of the stars, a procedurally generated universe waits before your eyes, near infinite planets, monster, weapons and experiences await you all form the comfort of your own spaceship! I gladly give it a 10/10, and its very much deserving of a spot in my favorite games of all time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are a handful of races to pick from with the decision actually making some difference in that each race has their own spaceship and their own interpretation of the things you encounter dring your travels (using the analyze tool 'n')There are numerous different planet types as well as near infinite monsters and weapons thanks to the marvel that is procedural generation further increasing the desire to travel the universe in search off 'all of the things' so to speak. During your travels expect to come across friendly and unfriendly sentient races in the form of villages and dungeons. Races such as the robotic glitch, sentient robots trapped in a medievil type state, or the floran, savage plant people with a slightly backwards society. Every race can be found during your travels going about there lives, running shops, farming etc and greatly increases the immersion within the game itself. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some notes on the state of the beta as of 11/03/2014At the moment the content is a little on the lacking side (compared to the scope mapped out on the roadmap, available on the starbound website) but the devs have shown since release there dedication not just adding there own ideas to the game, but also incorporating popular mods being produced by the massive and ever growing community already present. The progression of the game at the moment is a placeholder waiting to be properly implemented until a later stage of beta, once all the systems are incorperated. Currently players progress by tiers of ore but eventually this will be replaced with three branching paths allowing for three compeltely unique playstyles. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading :)!-JohnnyTAA\n",

      "As somebody that ride MTB with the closest downhill track being ages away this seemed like a good game. Boy was I wrong The controls in the game were clunky and at time unresponsive. I understand that this game is early in its life but come on not including sound when riding the bike! that is something that should have been added in a beta at least. I didn't play the game enough to get a feel for the store or all the levels but that isn't going to change the review as these can't change the game core physics unless the different bikes change how you ride(only would change it a bit).  If you want to ride a MTB start small this game is doing it no justice go out to your local trail have some fun with some friends no matter your ability there is something for you to do. I may take another look at this game again in the future if they do a physics overhaul but until then im keeping the money that I refunded from this game and spending it hopefully on something better (can't stuff up two times in a row ;)  )   TL;DR : Core of game didn't work as expected, got refund.

There is quite a diverse list of tracks to choose from all of them are great classics and catchy pop tunes. when you start a song it seems to be pretty fast for the actually singing of the song but you get used to the speed after a while. As for multiplayer, so far it is only local multiplayer for those who have 2 mic's at home, i convinced my friend to get this so that we could vs each other online but it doesnt work that way, i hope they add online competitive singing or duets. Is the game fun, Yes. it is a great party game and i enjoyed having a laugh with my friends as we sang Born this way by Lady Gaga.

      "Remember playing Split Screen back in the day with four friends? Remember sticking to your own screen to avoid being called out as a screen cheat? WELL FORGET ALL THAT CRAP! Screen Cheat is a unique game that requires you to use the dirtiest of split screen moves. Players are invisible and the only way to kill them is to look at their screens, the game puts 4 (I'm not sure if it can play more than 4 players) players screens all on one screen so everyone can see what each other is equipped with and where they are on the map. You must use your skills and a range of wacky weapons to elimininate your opponents. The game, in my opinion should be free to play, but it is still heaps of fun to play with some friends over skype, screaming about F@$#%!? B*&%#@?! Kills and other screen cheating goodness. I give Screen Cheat a 7/10\n",

      "Pretty fun, especially since it's free, I haven't played it in ages but I have fond memories of roaming the lands with my friend, we did quests, got loot, pretended to be hobos living in dumpsters, untill we found an empty building and used that as a house, that was pretty fun. For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying ♥♥♥♥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that.\n",

      "This game is considered to be the worst main story of the franchise, it is true that it is not at all as scary as the older games were, but that doesn't mean it is a bad game. Graphics are decent, characters are interesting, Ada's campaign is just great and if you do this multiplayer it is just awesome. I would recommend this to people that just want to have fun smashing in zombie heads, and if you have a friend then go ahead and smash them together, but don't compare it to the other games as it really doesn't fit in with the style, it's a blast in its own way.\n",

      "im from SEA and can play with any server worldwide without any lags (unless receiving delayed damage is one of them)normally multiplayer games in steam are only recommended for NA and EU players since people there buy it legally but here in SEA rarely people buy it so you also rarely get friends to play with.bought this on sale and i wished i purchased the GOTY one but fell $5 short (can only buy the base game that was on discount)if there's a sale this month for this game, i will sell all my items to buy it. for now i can just buy the gage courier pack since people heavily recommends it\n",
      "played this since it was called Dragonica. really addicting mostly if you have friends to play with.You can do the normal dungeon instance or when you reach a specific level you can now also do Tower Defense Mode or even a raid type instance where it is possible to 1 hit you.I recommend reaching lv 20 or advancing to 1st job before reaching 1 day after character is created for the achievement.and also keep your lv 1 weapon as it is needed to get 10,000 combo with no problem (mostly you can get it around 25-28 as an archer and cleric and around 30+ for assassin, no clue on warrior/swordsman since you can just spam attack until 10k combo)\n",
      "This game. This game will make you work, experiment, cry, rage and tonnes more.On DST me and m friends only last to about day 6 because of HORRIBLE luck (I jumped in a wormhole w my friend and saw 18 hounds btw).Although its SO amazing.10000000/10 Would hound again.\n",
      "best game everthere always pinoy and russian ruin the gameparty with your friends or you get reported with no reasons100/10\n",
      "Disclaimer: the devs gifted me this game after i told them it was my bday (legends lol)This game is one of my favorite VR games at the moment, after a long day at work i come back home and have to play a few games of this just to unwind. Physics are great, everything from serving to hitting just feels right to me, would recommend this to anyone and will be buying an extra copy to gift to a friend just to support the devs!IF YOU HAVE VR BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!\n",
      "A very fun RTS, even better with friends.\n",
      "The game is very enjoyable, fun game with friends also a good game for single player. Overall an excellent game!!\n",
      "It like any other MMORPG but more animish. Most classes start of pretty boring, it become more fun as you level up. Best playing with friends. Story is decent, and gameplay is good.\n",
      "Sniper Elite V2 is a fun game to play with friends in the Co-op mode but that and the single-player feel extremly scribed. I love the bullet cams. This game is great for $15<  but nothing more.\n",
      "This is a really fun game to play with friend, but pretty boring by yourself.\n",
      "nice game to play with friends if your bored but wouldnt recommend this to the RPG nut who probably lives down the road :D. if your bored and just wanna pass time then this game is for you (so is minecraft if your willing to pay) otherwise i recommend to that guy...\n",
      "A long time, this was my review:Spent 4 hours running to a military base and loaded up with so much ammo I could barely carry it. Then fell down a step and broke my legs. Crawled for 500m before someone handcuffed me and stole my pants. The same guy then shot my wife. 11/10Little has changed feature wise since then, but the gameplay has. It's not as fun. More hackers, and those that don't  kill on sight. The emergent gameplay of \"is this guy friendly or hostile\" that made it great has gone.\n",
      "One of the best of the Call of Duty series to date. Has a great story that is worth replaying just for the awesome atmosphere and set pieces. Multiplayer community is smaller than what it once was, but is still quite easy to get a game going. Highly recommend to play with friends!\n",
      "so fun to play with friends\n",
      "Although in it's early Alpha stages with numerous bugs and plentiful connection issues, this game is actually quite fun. Unlike the ARMA 2 mod, this game will be specifically tailored to be a zombie game, instead of war with zombies thrown in. There are very few zombies and the people on it are murderous and unpredictable, but you will always get a story out of it to tell your friends. Survive how you want or build your community and strike the zombies before they strike you. There will be many improvements made and the game is far from finished but I believe that this will be the most emmersive Zombie-Survival game yet.\n",
      "Definitely recommended for people who love to trade hats for hundreds or thousands of dollars.Basically if you have no money, you will automatically find a job and then spend all of your salary on hats.Hats are love, hats are life.But really, TF2 is actually a really great game for whoever likes FPS games with fast-pacing and different environments.TF2 is truly a fun game. It never really gets old, whenever I play it, I always am entertained by the different people I meet on the servers, if you want new friends, this game will introduce a huge amount of audiences. And now I am lazy to write. See ya nerds including myself since I will now enter the Team Fortress 2 dungeon and return in a E.T.A of 10,000,000 years.\n",
      "Fun game, team can be ♥♥♥♥ at time, play with friends for best experience\n",
      "Normally Sequals are expected to be superior to the orginal but unfortuanly this is not always the case. The singleplayer campagn is laughably  boring and rather prodictable. Muiltiplayer is ok with friends.Little from the Supreme Commander/forged alliance survived.Amphious or underwater walking gone.(not hover)More Experimentals just less effective, clones like the soul ripper 2 and fatboy 2 are shadows of thier formersevles.Aoen have no navy.Graphics have not been imporved.AI while more challanging at first will bore hardcore/RTS veterens.Not much stratagy, whoever spurns out more units fastest wins. Less maps and smaller.Cybran commander looks deformed.Tech tree and tier system gone. Replaced with exp system which become pointless once everything has been unlocked.Economy has no running costs for Shield generators nor artillary This game feels so watered down it is just not funny. if you loved the first game stay away from this mess if you didn't like the orginal then it will bore you.\n",
      " Starbounds History Starbound is a game that is hated and loved by its community. At the moment the Devs are very active towards posting stuff on their starbound website. I fully understand people’s frustration with the Dev’s (Chucklefish) and how they shaped the game. The game has gone through many updates that remove core mechanics and add new mechanics, altogether the where slowing down their goal to finish the game by changing what they had already built and not focusing on what to do next with the players experience. “They were just fixing stuff that did not need fixing”At the start of starbounds early access release I bought four copies for my mates so that we could all play on my local server. We had tones of fun exploiting bosses and endlessly reading throughout the wiki for answers. We finished the game when we hit the max rank tier. From there I played again, I started experimenting on how long the game was if you only cared about getting the highest tier armour set. But the game had exciting news “Nightly build”I knew that the nightly build would delete my character so I saved him. But when I entered the nightly/unstable build I saw what the Dev’s opinions were on their old stable build. They wanted to remake the tiers, they wanted to remake how you got through the game by adding quests, and overall they were controlling how you levelled through the game and scraping their old work which increased development time. - But they added a huge improvement to the rest of the game (weather, weapons etc).Starbound now has a better story and realism to what your character is doing but you don’t get the feeling of playing like you used in the old build. The game itself Starbound starts off with you choosing your character. After you have chosen you character and spent ten minutes customizing him/her to be perfect. You end up in your ship which is broken and ruined, you are then forced to go to the planet below and mine resources to fix your ship. You continue through the story crafting tiers of crafting tables to get the “next best thing” and completing quests. Throughout your adventure you will kill unique bosses and listen to startbounds Fantastic soundtrack! Conclusion I would suggest you to look at the games state (Current build and community) and think, is this game for me?-\tDo I like adventure through space and finding better weapons and resources?-\tDo I like following quests and helping NPCS be lazy-\tDo I like pimping my house so I can show off to my friends.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sz2zr3pZEoThis video is about the recent winter unstable update.\n",

      "Hmm. Where to start... If you grew up watching Dragonball/Z/GT, and enjoy fighters/multiplayer, you'll enjoy this game.You get the storyline mode, as well as a mission-type mode (Single player and CO-OP) the PVP is also very fun and competitive. If you loved dragonball for the plot, youll love this. If you loved dragonball for the action, youll love this too.There is one single thing that should be listed though, unless you have good ping to JP from AU, as well as access and knowledge of port forwarding, you will suffer a lot of connection problems. Mine have since been fixed after forwarding ports. There are a few hackers in PVP, which are easily avoided by playing with friends.You will find no better Dragonball Z to GT experience in a game than what you get from this one. It's worth the money, so is the DLC.And the option of being able to switch the audio to Japanese or English makes it that much betterNOTE: Some features are specific to your region's version of the game.\n",
      "Very fun and challenging game for a group of friends to play!Ate through my entire night until I passed out on my PC, which rarely happens.5/7\n",
      "A game about being chased by a gazillion zombies and not being givin enough time to pick up guns with no ammo in them. this game is in early access but scince its not finished i cant blame the bugs. as they are being fixed constantly by 1 gauy which had made the internet crazy over it so i has alot of flare. the fact thet your items is shared across servers kinda bugs me as its a survival game but its difficult to find so that also puts me with the server sharing. speaking of servers there is no server list, for me to play coop with my friends we needed hamachi which was a but annoying because the last time i did that was when i was playing minecraft so nelson make a server list and have a optional keep item when you die plz and yea get it before it costs mones because this could just be the new minecraft when its finished\n",

      "gmod is amazing and is filled with hours of random things to do but heres what i thibk about the most popular gamemodesTTT: ttt is a detectives type gamemode where innocents are trying to find traitors before traitors kill all the innocents, it is fun but on my first few matches i was killed randomly with in 30 seconds. it is much more fun if you have friends.sandbox: probably the best mode and the default one. just mess around thats it, so its funRoleplay: no... just no.Guess who: my second favourite gamemode hunters trying to find players in a mass of npc's fun, so yea.Prophunt: fun until you get killed with in 30 seconds and have to wait till the round time counter is up because there is a prop that is really well hidden, dontcha just love waiting?murder sorta like TTT so same things apply, the exact same things.if you want to have some real fun your gonna need addons and lots of them so be warnedover all its fun with lots of things to do but is always better with friends     10/10 would nuke everything again.\n",
      "Spec Ops: The Line is actually pretty fun to play. It is not as hyped as other games but it is definitely worth playing. This game is a unique third-person shooter that is unlike any before it. The story is well written and from time to time the players will have to make moral choices that will affect how the story plays out and how your team feels towards you. The multiplayer is a bit of a letdown only because of the fact that there is hardly anyone online as no one really plays this underrated game. However, there is an option for co-op so in that regards if you have friends with this game, you will always have someone to play with and complete the story together. Overall I give it 8/10.\n",
      "Ok, AMAZING GAME! :D I love it. Bought it, played it the whole day. Sadly, a ♥♥♥♥ tone of bugs and glitches.1. THE EDGES OF STAIRS ARE A ♥♥♥♥♥ ( no offense )2. When I click the \"Find a Game\" button it freezes. This did not happen b4.3. Some people lag massivly within the game when hectic. My friend just wants to play the game but he wasted his money to buy a game that doesnt even work on his computer. ( this game )4. Besides the crapload of glitches AMAZING GAME! Would defenitly recommend it... ... When it officialy comes out.\n",

      "Pros:-One of the best co-op game of all time.-Fun with friends-A ton of mod to unlock-Nice soundtrack-There are some free DLC's, too.Cons:-Friends/Foes AI are not smart.-The graphic engine is a little bit outdated.-There are no drill that really works properly.-Guard is too much easily paranoid in Overkill and Death Wish Recommended: Buy the GOTY edition when it's on sales and you won't regret it.\n",

      "SAVE THE KING!This is one of my favourite LAN party games. It's easy to get into and has dark humour.If you enjoy pouring boiling oil on your friends and see them scream in agony as a trebuchet throws them across the map then this is the game for you.Highly recommended.\n",
      "I liked Chivalry, but then came the archers in numbers bound in worlds worth of size, not yet seen by mankind til this time. The flying projectiles manage to pin and penetrate endless numbers of good armour, and that armour took man hours to hammer away at clasps and all sorts of defence, and yet war is the answer. Archers if you are targeting the good souls in this world of turmoil and destruction, I am your enemy. Many a bow I have broken, and all shall be destroyed in my presence, lest you draw your arrows against any friend. Join me in the archer salvation, for it is a requirement to be fulfilled before the Chivalry may live on!\n",

      "This is the game one would get by crossing the elements of Pure sandbox gameplay and RPG gameplay. In other words, you are free to do what you want while building up your character to suit your gameplay.In essence this game can be played any way you prefer, but it's best played with a few friends.\n",
      "all my friends play this game. it has taken from me money, time and effort. in return i have lost my faith in humanity and i doubt everyone i meet and their ability to ward. my life is ruined and i have never been happier.\n",
      "I was honestly surprised when I tried this out, Depth is a game that you don't come across regularly, think of it like evolved but with everything done right. The gameplay is solid, easy to pick up and pretty hectic. Keeping your cool while being stalked by player controlled sharks is a must. I would recommend playing it with friends, for me the experience was amazing with just one friend tagging along. But don't go on my word alone check out some gameplay videos to see if its for you. I had a blast I'd give it a 8/10\n",
      "*Review made a few days after EA release*Swordy is not for every PC, make no mistake, Swordy is a niche game requiring Multiple controllers, Friends, and a willingness to wait until those meetups to play the game... (and it only really starts getting fun with a third (or more) person(s) too)...To those having a Party with a few friends around, Must grab.To those looking for a single player experience, Don't get it yet, Wait a few months and see how the single player modes progress and then re-evaluate Swordy is a Unique \"Arena Party Game\" In the vein of \"Starwhal\" or \"Duck Game\" or \"SpeedRunners\". They are great, fun, and silly... though there's a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal \"new\" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of \"Honourable combat\", \"Casual rulemaking\" and \"Improvisation mid combat\"\"Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...\"Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there's nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging \"epic memorable moments\", everything feels fair (even when it's unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a \"Mutators screen\" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it's just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It's also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you're running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn't lose it's lustre quickly, Get it if you're sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you're the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!\n",
      "Epic game fun to play with friends and really AWSOME!!!!!!!\n",
      "Great online game and full of action. Community is great and friendly.\n",
      "Haha, Oh man.. This is a game I will always remember. You want a short review on this game? Alrighty, I should be able to give you one, I've played this game plenty, just, not on steam.Granted, I've not played this game in quite some time, but there is one thing you must understand: Elite Moderaters. They are either going to be your best friend, or, they'll be some punk two year old, that is crying over the fact that \"YOU SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥, YOU'RE USING A DAMN SHOTGUN! GTFO!\" with the message of \"You've been kicked out of the match by the Elite Moderater.\" The game has a bit of a... History, with Hackers. I don't know if they've fixed that, but for some time, Elite Mods were Nexon's way to deal with it. MOST of the community however, if you were in a normal game lobby, dispised the hacker as much as you did, and wouldn't hesitate to vote kick his ♥♥♥ out.\n",

But if you do want to get this game, wait till its on sale, you can get it for around $1.20 - $2.50. Great game.ps. i really want Australian servers!\n",
      "Deffinately the best game on my account, i love it, but only with friends, the AI teammates dont get you anywhere, but you can do it with at least 1 other friend and its a great game again. Deffitately worth a shot.\n",
      "Amazing Co-op game that had some much depth but sadly abandoned. It is now hardly ever played which is rather sad. If you can get together 4 of your friends all with voice chat this would be a fantastic game. But you would get bored with the limited maps. Alien Swarm: a game with so much possibility\n",
      "EVen though this game is old, it is full of great gameplay. With Civ 3 Complete you can play multiplayer, which allows you to share your conquests with your friends. This is what makes civ 3 a great game.\n",
      "This game is nice to play with friends. Now you can even play games with a total of 32 players, however, I've only every seen one other playing in the online lobby, and he was AFK. The game play isn't fantastic but I thoroughly enjoy this RTS. I appears much slower paced than most other RTSs I've played. Although, I would only buy this game when it is on special, like now for instance.\n",

      "Dota flippin 2, by a long shot my fav game to play on the good ol pc. (not like i play anything else though) This game is prehaps one of the best freetoplay game ever. ok correction, is the best freetoplay game ever. Dota 2 has a very sketchy begining for most players. I really didnt see what was so good about at the begining, it felt........ bland and not very exiting. but after a few matches with my friends and a few good wins, MY LIFE BECAME DEDICATED TO MASTERING THIS GAME. And now ever after 503 hours i still have a very long way to go. Dota 2 has a big learning curve at the begining, as you'll here from every other player. There are so many aspects of the game to learn. But even at the begining it is insainly fun, and as you develop your skill the game becomes more and more enjoyable. And if you get really good you can assemble a worthy team, and if our teams got the skillz to pay the billz you can run for the Dota 2 International championships, however that an very very long shot. but hey the prize money is 10 million flippin dollars this year, and next year it will grow even bigger. So why not try hey.So go flippin get this game and waste thousands of enjoyable hours of your life doing no much.(And please please what ever you do, dont play F**KING RIKI)\n",
      "FREAKING AWESOME GAME! a must get, no matter what!If your friends tell you not to get it, get rid of them. you don't need that kind of negativity in your life.\n",
      "depicts the real survival aspect of humanity where people will kill eachother for their itmes repeatedly ,good game if you dont mind running about for most of the game getting items staying alive and being shot on sight by most then rinse and repeat,personally i find it eventfull and interesting to survive and meet/help players. recommend you play with friends (a large group)there is strengthy in numbers\n",
      "game is great amazing loved it would recmond for any body and friends\n",
      "i love this series got all of them (on PC only) and now this.reminds me of dynasty warriors but with nep nep.also the games runs great and 60FPS in game (at least for me) and nice options for PConly partial gripe is not really keyboard friendly (altho i do use a PS4 controller) will say mouse works fine though.Basically if you like neptunia games but wanted it to be dynasty warriors game then you will love this game.\n",
      "This game is amazing everyone must play this game has steam add-ons  from steam this game starts really good and really intense in some parts with friend from the first l4d game it holds the first l4d charaters and the new characters\n",
      "Instant action the moment you press go to war. A good challenge, no tips every five secconds, battling other armies on planet then sending your forces to other planets via teleportation is sweet and the campaing needs a little bit more content.None the less, the game looks amazing and plays well, i only wish more of my friends had this so i could annihilate them too.\n",
      "3 stages of units, Gameplay can be long but it has its perks, would reccomend playing with friends though.\n",
      "Boring, I used to play this 2 years ago back when wildshadow ( something like that ) owned the game. The game then was not milked and droopy like a 4 year old cow after the farmer's just lost a child, and then Kabam ( tm or some ♥♥♥♥ ) came and ruined everything by bringing in these fancy package deals. 10/10 would not play. My friends would waste money on this basic game.\n",

      "Because partying up with friends doesn't exist, get ready to watch the same ♥♥♥♥heads enter and leave the lobby in an attempt to play with their friends...this will cause VERY few matches to start. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, not even when they add some party support.*UPDATE*Newest update comes with a glitch that put me in a game and a lobby AT THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING TIME. Close the game and re-open it only to find that I've now lost All of my rankings that I've gained over the last 2 hours of playing. ♥♥♥♥ these Devs10/10 would never Buy againIf your complaining that the games to hard for the killer. ♥♥♥♥ OFF AND CAMP A HOOK LIKE EVERY ♥♥♥♥WIT THAT PLAYS THE KILLER. I honestly hope the Devs update the game to punish you campy little ♥♥♥♥♥es. However that won't happen, because to many whiney sociopaths that like to que up alone to live out their phantasy of being a killer. EVER person is playing the trapper. The trapper is completely broken, its NOT fun to randomly run into bear traps that were for the most part unavoidable. Seriously, this game has no balancing to it in the slightest.1 - Killer is faster then survivors, fair enough2 - Trapper has 6 bear trappers (maybe more) and believe me, your not going to disarm or sabotage the majority of them3 - half of all barriers that survivors can drop are so poorly placed that the killer actually saves time by going around...litrally making the mechanic redundant.4 - Killers perks are by far better then anything the survivors get...whats that? Survivors got rid of all the hooks on the map beside tha basement? Pfft, ♥♥♥♥ that. Killers got the iron grip perk meaning he can carry survivors for a complete lap around the map and straight to the basement.5 - Killer gets slowed down after successful hits to allow survivors to get away....MOTHER♥♥♥♥A I'VE GOT A PERK FOR THE TO AS THE KILLER.6 - Are the survivors hiding to well? ♥♥♥♥♥ please, I can see them through muther♥♥♥♥ing walls7 - Killer is capable of flatout killing without a hook...I know this is a rare mechanic in the game, but it makes the entire idea of the game redundant if the killer doesn't need hooks.8 -  Why was the game patched so that killers get points for disconnecting survivors...yet not the other way around? Seriously, survivor gets jack ♥♥♥♥. Not the killer though, because the dev team has a HUGE hard on for serial killers.9 - Because now ever tryhard is playing the trapper killer, it's literally no different then the beta...have you played the beta? Well then don't bother because unless YOU want to play one of the other two killers, you'll never see them. Making every game fustrating, repetitive and boring.10 - I've mentioned camping killers right? Why doesn't the game punish campers by harshly reducing their points if they stay near a certain distance of hooked survivors. The trapper has plently of time to stop any rescue because he has 100% placed bear traps infront of the hook.11 - Notice how many of my points assume you are playing against a trapper...AGAIN, EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TRYHARD IS PLAYING THE TRAPPER! THIS GAME HAS BECOME SO STALE BECAUSE OF THAT. NERF THAT ♥♥♥♥ER OR TAKE HIM OUT ENTIRELY.I'll finally leave this off by informing you that I've had MORE bugs and game breaking glitches since the recent patches. Now be honest, does that sound like a developer that you want to support in anyway. This is a sub par product, a cool idea but nothing more. This game has angered me quite a lot, and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mood that the game has put me in comes back the moment I consider playing this game again. Wait for the \"Friday the 13th\" game or the successfully kickstarted \"Last Year\" if you want a game that has similiar ideas. Because this game is at best worth 5 bucks and maybe 2 hours of your time. I've played as much of this game as I can stomach so that I can say I gave this game a fair chance. I'll be avoiding this developer like the plaque they are, very disapointing product.\n",

      "This game was probably my first favorite game that I ever had. It was on a mac then moved on to windows but was still fun. The physics is amazing and the creativity is endless. But there is a lack of addons and content in Blockland. luckly there is return to blockland (rtb) which you can download addons from the cumminity, manage friends etc. it would be much better if they added Return To Blockland as a DLC on something along those lines. I was excited that it had finally been added to steam. I  REALLY recomend this game I give it a 9.2/10. Also one more thing, I felt abit sad that the maps where removed :( I know some of them where pretty bad but not the ones such as the Bedroom or the kitchen they where pretty good maps. I wish for them to bring the maps back, now that would give me a 10/10!EDIT: ITS BEEN a month..where are the MAPS?\n",

      "Awesome game with friends :D\n",
      "H&G is a great game, I would highly recconmend it. For one, its great for playing with friends. And the fact thats its FREE!!! :DSo deffently give it a go. I mean i'm loving it, but I guess you already know that just by looking at my hours! :PAnyway, so its a multiplayer game and its set in World War 2. So you have three avalible factions, which are The United Sates, Germany (duh), and the Soviet Union (Russia) you should know that the Soveits were the Russians :P. Duh!Haha! Anyway, so you can go to and fro with each of your charactrs. So i'm going to stop saying so much and let YOU experience it for yourself; so have a go! (Get a whole bunch of your friends, make a squad, and i'm sure you'll have a ball! :)\n",
      "This game is a great game to play with other people and compete with your friends!\n",
      "This game is amazing. Amazing. I can't believe how good this game is for five dollars. FIVE DOLLARS! This Survival: postapocalypse Now is by far the best game i've ever played for under 20$. The game really does feel great, There aren't any bugs I have encountered, and I've had fun every minute I've been playing it, but be warned, depending on your luck, it could either be a pvp or very friendly game. I highly recommend playing with a friend or two. With this game, you really do get what you pay for, plus more.Overall I think it is underpriced, and you know a game's good when you play it for almost 5 hours from when you download it and have to go to sleep! :)\n",
      "Great game episcally when playing with friends\n",
      "I highly HIGHLY enjoy Portal, Only because myself, I love me a good puzzle!Wanna do some Puzzles with a friend? Portal 2 is your game.I really can't say anything bad about this game, I am overwhelmed with good things but I can't say one, There are to many to just say a couple!\n",

      "After 3 hours of gameplay, I found out this game is pretty cool and awesome. By the way ya this game needs a stronger PC to support it, the connecting needs more time than the others game. But it's fun playing it with friends.\n",
      "Hitman: Sniper Challenge is a branch off of the main game Hitman: Absolution. It offers a unique mission in which you test your skills as a silent assassin. Though small it can consume as much game time as the real game. Great for playing with friends.\n",
      "The Review: PreludeMy friend Jacko has reminded me that this game is early access, and cost me a whopping 99 cents AuD.The ReviewIf you have read my review of this game in the last few days, it was a do not recommend, with some frustration strewn throughout. However, I have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works. Now this review is happily a recommend :) although, there is a way to go, the bulk of the game is there, and appears to be solid enough. Oh, and may I also recommend that you start playing as an Assult class. It is a simple class, and one that gets you a feel for the game nicely.The backgroundI played Orion: Prelude, and when this came out - BAM insta-buy. I finally get around to trying it, and it's no longer First Person view. :( This may not be a deal breaker for you, but that's what I love playing. (I've been informed below that in version 1.5, FPV is back!)The GameThere are two modes of view. Top down third person, and over the shoulder third person. (And the v1.5 First Person)Things I like:Looks quite nice. (GTX 750 Ti)The harvester has a sense of humour! :DThere appears to be a lot of work gone into the tech/upgrade tree. Hopefully this will allow for diverse / specialised set ups for people.Now that I have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view. I can see why Jacko (again) said that he really enjoyed his first play, and made friends. He's pretty easy to get along with when you first meet - so that's a good sign. :) I'm yet to delve into the online version of this, as my time was short.Things I don't like:The jump binding is conveniently called \"Roll\". (dual purpose - In actual fact, the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllers.)The game takes a while to load, but shows no indication that it is indeed loading. In fact, it doesn't even show up on the taskbar - making me think, each time, that it's frozen. (Intel Core i5-4690 2.5GHz / 16GB RAM / Win 10)The character that is \"you\" seems disconnected from the world. That is to say, that the world could be projected onto a wall, and \"you\" just dance around in front of it. (For over the shoulder view)The action of the grenade throw, and the actual grenade movement is lame. Needs work. (\"early access\")Certain characters (ie: Assault) insist upon saying \"look at me go\" every time you use the jetpack. Not a major gripe, but I hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100% of the time.Discoveries:F1 Key switches between views. (Thanks Jacko)Despite you view not being First Person (out of the visor), the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing. And as I wrote above, and you'll read in the comments, in version 1.5, true first person view will be back.I can't tell if it's my underspec'd character, or that the jump / boost ceiling is very low. But getting around up high is very hard.If you do manage to get up above the ground, only the dino flyers even attempt to get you. Most ground dinos become confused, and don't necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objective.There are Hats - TF2, oh how you've changed the world.There are drops and chests to be found.Dem FeelsMy initial feelings about this game was that I didn't get it. I got the Prelude, but this one... Now that I have rejiggerd the controls, and played it again on a simpler class - I had more of an affinity for it. So I'm happier now.The End BitI'm sure more things will come to light as I play this in multiplayer mode. And I'm glad I gave this game another chance. I look forward to seeing where the devs take this.Thanks to Jacko, Neomeinx and Cjnfl for helping me with this review.\n",

      "Short and sweet:Do not buy this early access hoping for any lasting entertainment with friends.In it's alpha state the developers have not made it easy for player interaction through the game.The map is 220square km's! There are no vehicles yet, hope you like running aimlessly finding one of the 39 other players.There are a lot of useless items often with useless descriptions on how to use them.You cannot spawn reliably with friends, you must find them often taking hours.Zombies are still buggy and walk through doors and combat ridiculous.This review is for the current alpha state and to give a perspective for players wanting to jump in expecting a zombie survival experience with friends.This review will be changed when core mechanics are solid.\n",
      "I tried to like this game, I really did but...Nothing about the game seems finished... including the actual game. Taking the episode approch, if you want to even finish this game you'll have to pay for the inital game and then for each new episode. The entire game is buggy to the point where simply trying to play the game gets frustrating. If you progress though the story, try to do a simple dilevery quest, try to farm... I assure you you will find a bug that makes it unplayable. I can understand early release on games for a community that have waited a long time but ... is it to much to ask for the core game mechanics to be functional prior to \"release\"?Finally, the towns people... I know they have a secret... I understand it is part of the story (even if you can't get immersed in the story due to the aforementioned bugs which ruin it)... I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage? You move in and they quite literally treat your existance there as a crime... it's a farming sim not a maximum security prison. I have to child proof my house because I am worried my little farming buddy might have some suicidal tendencies with all the from all the abuse. It will make it very hard to forgive them when... if they ever view you as a friend. I can't play the game as it is right now... I will give it one more chance when it is complete but as of now nothing about this game is fun. Harvest Moon got it right just stick with them for now.\n",
      "The game is ok overall, with the top selling point being you are able to create your own DBZ fighter. You are able to make her/him an absolute unstoppable force with a sense of style but to get those moves and clothes you better be ready for countless hours of grinding on the same mission. If you do grind make sure to do so with a friend because bots are about as helpful as Yamcha in a fight… and sometimes you actually have to keep them alive. The DBZ xenoverse character selection is meagre at best, opting for the lesser known minions such as siberman, raspberry, or appule to occupy the limited spots. In saying that though 90% of the time you only want to play as your creation anyway. Finally if you just wanted to hang out with your friend on the online server in tokitoki city, good luck it is near impossible to be on the same server and you can’t invite each other. Overall the gameplay is ok, the controls fine, and the fighting fair (you can’t spam ki blasts). Any shortcomings xenoverse has may be fixed with upcoming DLC.\n",

      "Played the Saints Row games for a very long time and each game always brings a little something extra to the table. SR4 has......questionable...interactions with fellow friends in the game. Many may not like it but i think the developers had a good kick out of iuncluding it in the game. If you don't know what i mean you will after playing thios game for a few hours.Unfortunatily no matter how awesome Saints Row VI is i can't get behind the aliens.Specifically driving down a section of road just chillen to hack a station and they will just pop up out of nowhere when you haven't even raised a enemy alarm. Just annoys alot cause you can barely get a good pedestrain bumper combo before the alein swarm wrecks everything. Awesome game with new powers, weapons that run on energy instead of bullets so that's a huge saving in ammo.The ability to run super-fast and smash vechiles out of the way is really awesome if you need a quick getaway.\n",
      "I love this game so much already <3Gameplay:This game can be odd and very hard to pick up when you first start, But it is very friendly to keyboard and mouse players instead of alot of games that need you to have a controller. You just have to use WASD right and left click, and spacebar. Thats it, its very easy to pick up after you realize all of your moves. You dont instantly start off with a weapon. Items drop from the sky such as bombs, mines, spiked balls, and your weapon. Each person has one weapon that will match to another person. You have drills, swords, hammers, and a stick thing. (Forgot the name ;~;) But each person has different stats. This game is early access so everything isn't in play yet. Such as if you were to buy it right now all of the characters would be unlocked, you will have to unlock them later when the game is out of early access, then it will have some free players and for payed players they will have a rotation for that. Competitive play:There is competitve game play, there must be in every game that wants to prosper. In this competitive you have 3 ranks so far, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each one getting more and more harder people to fight. There are harder moves to do inn competitve, such as dodging, LEARNING your mains moveset, and also learning to fight without a weapon. Some of the people in competitve are very friendly and say GG after a match, unlike others that just leave right after. You will run into the same peoplethat use the same main. This is why you have to stick with your main and be a low teir god.Casual play:With competitive they have casual for..casual players. Instead of being 1v1 like in competitive you go in a 4 player FFA. They have all the same moves, items, and rules. So it really isnt different. The same thing goes for the people in competitive, some can be rude and others not. But in casual you arn't going to find the same mains over and over. This is where most people train combos for their main. They can also use training in vs CPU mod.My Thoughts:As a person that plays alot of Super Smash Bros. I can really see where they got their thoughts from. You attack people over time and the more they get attacked the farther they launch. But you cant shield, you cant grab ledge, and you cant just roll away and spam projectiles. As some classes have pistols they only fire close ranged. Most sword fighters in Super Smash are like the people with the guns in this game having to wall the other player out. But not like Super Smash they have 2 weapons instead of just one. I find this to be very creative and you can even drop them at any time!.Why should you buy this?This game really isnt like some combo crazy game like Mortal Kombat, MvC, or Super Smash Bros. Melee. This game is more trying to get as much damge racked up and is very friendly to new players, as a new wave of them had just come out today becuase of Loot Crate giving out codes for this game. If you like games much like Super Smash Bros 4. This would be the perfect game for you. But if you like combo crazy games you should try and stay away. There is currently another game like this that I'm pretty sure will be less friendly to keyboard and mouse players than last, and has a big learning curve just like Melee, with wave dashing and such. If you buy this game, have fun with it!\n",
      "this game has a great story and the multi-player is great the community is friendly and i have heaps of friends that play this. I do recommend this game. 4.5/5 stars\n",
      "Let me tell of a recent adventure I had while playing this with my friend...We started on a large island. Wasn't as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn't bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn't too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, \"Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!\"-pls excuse bad inggris.\n",
      "This game is fun, Bit buggy with the multiplayer for me in that i cant connect through the actual game. I do have fun with it though. But its not worth its full price id wait for a sail honestly, See what i did there?Sail?...I bought this game for one dollar and think that is the appropriate price, also if you're buying this game you should make another friend buy it aswell as it is dull playing by yourself. in the end, Extremely fun and a classic, simple masterpiece of a game\n",

ID RATHER PLAY DAMN LEFT 4 DEAD, THAT REPETITIVE ♥♥♥ GAME THAN THIS. that said this game is still repetitive if not more repetitive than damn l4d or l42. other than your average hunters you start off with, you need to pay to get hunters, and monsters. i spent 50 bucks i better get something out of this. THIS IS MORE OF A COMPLAINT THAN A REVIEW IM SORRY BUT STILL GIVE IT A TRY BUT STILL JUST DONT SUPPORT THE GAME BY SPENDING AT ALL.....................\n",

If you going to buy the game go look up HoxHud mod it really helpful.\n",
      "Gameplay is pretty good, but this game has it's problems. For one, it has one of the worst management systems for \"friends\" I have ever seen. It is almost impossible to add friends while within the game, so you have to go to the website to do it. The in-game menu is extremely limited, cluttering your screen with oversized button for some things, such as how to spend real-world money, while leaving other buttons, notably those to do with other people and closing smaller menus, incredibly small. Furthermore, the game gives you NO INSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER on how to do anything but gameplay. while it does instruct basic gameplay rather well, it doesn't matter if you can't find your way into a match. While the game does also give you links to guides and intructions by other players on YouTube, these guides and instructions are outdated, and differ (a lot) from what the game is now. However, the gameplay is quite good, and the menus can be navigated with some practice. The major downside is the social system.Edit: I found how to add friends. The instructions on how to do so are halfway down this page that gets openned up by this tiny button in the corner. the instructions are two lines out of hundreds, and in this tiny little text.\n",

      "An enthralling game about one of the many untold stories set during Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring. A thorougly enjoyable experience that should definitely be part of any Lord of the Rings fans collection.I had a great time playing this game several times through, agonizing over which pieces of armour I should keep, having friendly chats with several members of the Fellowship, and significant others, while playing the game through each time with a different character, forcing me to rethink my battle strategies every time.The only downside I found in this game is how overpowered the crossbow was. I managed to defeat the final boss (who is supposed to be the hardest in the game) in under a minute on heroic difficulty.\n",
      "This game is good ♥♥♥♥ if you play it in 20 hour bursts at intervals of about 20 weeks. Much potential but lacking in a lot of things. Fun with friends and can be alright playing alone but a posse is recommended. Needs better ♥♥♥♥♥ loot spawns though, jesus.\n",
      "I accidentally collateralled a guy through a zombie and his friend pushed me off the building into the zombie horde below. I just survived and started running away before a child zombie pushed me into a trash can. I fell through the map and my computer blue screened. 10/10\n",

      "Don't get me wrong, the game is great! But I simply can't let these issues go by:Why I don't care about the F2P change:The game was dying, so they made it free to try to save their game. Am I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for losing 60 bucks? Yes, I am. But they had to do this or I would never have the chance to enjoy this game again. Also, the founders edition gives people who bought the game a lot of stuff, they also promised to make even more little things for the people who have been supporting them since the start. This means that us, founders, the people who really cared for this game, will continue to get more EXCLUSIVE itens. In short, the reason for this review isn't the F2P change, It's because  of the stupid ways they changed the game to please idiots who played 2 minutes of the game and started screaming ♥♥♥♥ about the it. *cof* *cof* AngryJoe *cof* *cof*. What they have ♥♥♥♥ed up:They made the dome a shared ability, something I do not agree with since it takes away a huge part of being a trapper and also discourages teamwork. Also, you can't miss. But that barely scraches the surface of the problem, they also added regenerative health and even though It's already way too fast, there are perks that can greetly speed it up. The medic only becomes useful during combat, which now It's the focus of the game. There's no such thing as stealth, there's only Planet Scanners every 30 seconds who force the monster to constantly run, actually he doesn't need to run, because he can teamwipe at stage 1. In fact, they should call this game Not Evolve. They also decreased the dropship time to a minute and a half, there goes one of EMET strengts. What they turned the game into:In short, they turned a game about Hunting into a Massive Monster Batteling Cluster♥♥♥♥, made Evolve not worth Evolving and destroyed teamwork. This game is BROKEN gameplaywise and they need to remove this friendly piece of ♥♥♥♥ mechanics that they decided to add. People who started playing now won't even notice, but we do, and if this doesn't get changed we will forever miss what Evolve used to be.PS: Where did all the maps and modes go?\n",
      "Amazing Game. Recommended!After playing Subnautica for a while, I noticed that the game is beautiful and extremely diverse for an Alpha. The game has problems, don't buy it unless you have a beast PC. The game is NOT optimized yet! FPS Drop is your best friend when loading parts of the map. The game is still in Alpha, think well before buying it! It has a lot of things to do for now, don't buy the game and get mad about it just because it's crashing and blablabla, It's Alpha and you've been warned several times.P.S: The developers of this game are amazing! Count on them to help you.\n",
      "AN amazing game that is great to play with friends or by yourself and will keep you challenged through all of the dtages no matter what level you are.\n",
      "This game is hard, but that makes it fun. You should buy this and play with some friends, it'll challenge your friendship!\n",
      "Definitely a fun and ammusing game to play. Whether you are taking your time and farming up, or raiding others and trolling around. This game is just plain fun in any aspect. Since it's also only in Alpha, definitely get in on the fun and play the game while it develops and only gets better. I like how the game removed the zombies as most other survival games have zombies. Which allows for this game to offer a bit more of a unique style to the stale market or survival games. I just get sick of zombies to be perfectly honest. They are way over done. I find it fun to able to play a game such as this early in development and find all the funny and stupid things. Such as getting chicken from anything but chickens. If you are unsure whether to buy this game or not. You shouldn't put it off! It's crazy fun and makes for some good times. With or without friends. Even when you are killed and killed and killed many times by farmed people. You always seem to want to get back in it and get them back :DSO GET THIS GAME!!But if you are one of those people who insists on seeing a game for yourself before you play it. Just check out some of the streamers on twitch. Some of those guys have 1000+ hours and will be able to show you how to play the game for the best start. So you will be able to choose whether to buy it or not, but also not go into the game completely out of knowledge!  Hope this review helps your decision!\n",

We set up camp and built houses next to each other,. We spent the next in-game week making one massive base together with metal doors to protect us from the bandits. Everything was swell until we heard gunshots in the distance. We climbed on top of our house to see what was going on and saw a few bandits in the distance. We thought nothing of it and went back inside. About five minutes later we heard a massive explosion, one of my team said that it sounded like a C4 explosion. We go downstairs and sewe that one of our doors has been blown off. Next thing we know 6 guys in kevlar come into our house holding m4's. We were outnumbered, 3 to 6. One of my mates pulls out a shotgun and shoots one of them in the head and kills them, about half a second later he is lying dead on the floor. One of the guys tells us to drop all our weapons on the ground as the other guys procede to looting all our hard earned goods. I dropped everything I had on me except for a P250 and some ammo. For about 20 minutes the two of us were being led by these raiders along a road when a guy with a bow starts shooting at them. He dies pretty much instantly but it gave us enough time to run. As gun shots whistle past my chest and head I begin to think this is it, I'm done for. We keep running we see some mountains up ahead. We start weaving through the mountains and we eventually loose the bandits. We set up camp and call it home. Over the chat the bandits are yelling abuse at us and saying that they will hunt us down, let us re-spawn and hunt us down again. That was 5 hours of playing Rust, I can't wait to see what happens next.TL;DR An amazing game, so much fun and it's only in early Alpha!\n",
      "Wouldnt think that valve could create a good game. CSGO is popular now and is very good with more modern weapons than it counter parts CS CZ CSS. But what i think makes the game good is the ability to add custom skins to all weapons including knives. The down side to the game is the competitive side the elo system is broken and theres players not in the correct ranks so it does make ranking harder to gain unless you play with higher ranked friends in a team.\n",
      "Ladys and Gentlemen Its time to take up arms against the worst enemy of all... GERMS.You take the fight to the messes in this mundane and boring simulatior. Cleaning up after horrible events have occured.Take the fight to the enemy on various battlefields.Surprisingly fun and enjoyable. Would Recommend The Fun caused by friends making more mess than beforeFinding the hidden bodys, and putting ogether the events that caused these horrible messes.The Most Fun you Can have With a Mop other than Jousting..BUY IT, PLAY IT, CLEAN IT!!!\n",
      "I enjoyed playing this game. It's a lot of fun in my opinion, although the story aspect of it doesn't really go anywhere.It did however endear me to the playable characters, I would actually love it they appeared again in resident evil canon, they are quirky if a bit sadistic and apathetic. That also goes for the spec op team as well, I found them to be quite likeable. It's the little in-game dialogue that really endears them to me.I've finished both the original and spec ops story lines and am still playing this game, the only pity is the fact that the online multiplayer is quite dead and unless you have a lot of friends with this game won't be able to enjoy.\n",

      " This game was amazing. This Life is Strange deserves more than a review... So here is my \"more than a review\"...Life is Strange, you have made my emotions go in so many different ways. You have made me question so many things in life on a daily basis. You have made me think hard. You have made me be more aware. But more importantly, you opened my eyes. You opened my eyes to the world and its realities. You have opened my eyes to what the world really has in store for us. Life is Strange, you made me see that things need to be payed attention to. But most important of all... You have made me open up to the fact that long lost friends can be the key to your life. You are the best thing I have ever had the pleasure of playing. From butterflies in bathrooms, to being trapped in an unimaginable situation. From being bullied to being a hero.\n",

      "HellDivers is a great game to play with friends or solo. Most sounds matches in well but music is a bit off at times. Graphics may not be the best but it doesn’t hurt the game, animations form gun fire to movement feel right. Controls are solid either with a keyboard and mouse or controller. Community can vary from game to game greatly is most of the time good. Gameplay is addictive and can be intense with a good difficulty curve for beginners on level 3 planets to experts on level 12 planets, there are a few negative thing in the game, running out of things to do is a big issue once you have unlocked all things form the planets there is nothing more to do but grind levels and samples for your character with nothing to spend research points on and no reason to keep playing. I have to say I may not be the greatest gamer but there really needs to be a difficulty above Helldive, as I have soloed and have seen many others solo Helldives this being the hardest difficulty you can get in there planet difficulty rating short of a boss battle (there is only a few of those) it leave you wanting something more. In the end this is a great game at a great price, I hope they bring out more DLC this could be more planets types, higher difficulty levels or unlock rewards in an expiation pack.\n",
      "Although it is the biggest rage simulator out there, I still keep coming back to this game. Also, the community is rarely friendly but if you don't care about that, then definitely buy this game.\n",
      "Playing this game fills up my empty heart anti social life. This game makes me feel as if I actually have a friend...Kappa\n",
      "Played Co-op and killed my friend over and over again. Never gets old!\n",
      "I had confidence this was going to be a game I'd play through while keeping a smile stuck on my face. And yet it managed to be a cherry sweater.If you are a fan of something mysterious, stories about friendship, a loving bond. This game is a must play.Even after finishing it, I do plan to come back to it again very soon.\n",
      "AMazing game 9/10 definetlythere is some bugs but it is definetly worth it The fact that I cant lobby with friends does kinda ♥♥♥♥ me off since i bought 2 friends the game, developers if u read this plz implement that u can 4 man lobby only as surviors just so u can play with friends it isnt game breaking for randoms if u are only 4 survivors and this would extend your game life a ♥♥♥♥ load\n",
      "Awesome game for LANs. Showed it to my friends at my most recent one, everyone was really getting in it and enjoying themselves. Could use a bit of updating but a solid fun game.\n",
      "HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: - buy it - just freaking buy it - start up the game - finish the first third of the main quest - go to the college of winterhold - get involved with the college of winterhold quest - finish that quest - wonder why the game finished so quickly - ask a friend - friend tells you that the College of Winterhold quest was just a side-quest, not the main quest - get even more confused - finally retrieve the horn of Jurgen Windcaller - continue from there - fight Alduin on the Throat of the World - do some elder scrolls ♥♥♥♥ - go the sovengarde or some ♥♥♥♥ - fight Alduin once again - kill him - go back to the throat of the world - wonder why the final boss fight with Alduin was just freaking easy - watch as a bunch of dragons salute you - wonder where the end credits went - close the game  - open the steam workshop page - download 50 skyrim mods - wait for thirty hours because your internet supplier is Dodo - start up the game - play for 200 hours more because of the mods - close the game - sleep - wake up - download 100 more mods - open the game - get an average of 15 fps because you accidentally installed an ENB - put out the fire that your shoddy amd radeon r7 created - look  at your monitor - bask in the next-gen x2 graphics that is a skyrim ENB - watch as your fps goes down to 2 fps as a chicken runs towards you - get blown up by a kamikaze chicken - respawn - get rekt by thomas the tank engine dragon - skyrim crashes - uninstall a few mods - waste the next 500 hours of your life on this game - die of starvation because you have not eaten in two weeksyeah so this game is better than 90% of games on steam\n",
      "Really fun multiplayer game, i like the creativity and uniqueness you get when building your own robot(flying thing still dont know what they are called) i play with my friends alot and they also enjoy it, can get tedious with only 1 game mode so far, but its in early acces so that's expected, al in all, i highly recommend this game to anyone\n",
      "Castle Crashers Quick ReviewThis is worth the money buy this awesome game you can play alone or fight in a team of your friends and can unlock awesome fighters, weapons and even little animals that float behind you!

      "I really think that if anyone enjoys the format of the super smash bros games then they should really consider this game! I'll go through the pros and cons of this gamePros:Good character rosterGreat art styleFree to play and not pay to winSeeing the game is based off a weapon system, you can learn to play as or play against other characters easierTONS of different playstyles to choose fromEasy to create custom matches with friendsReally good elo system, you'll notice the differences in the ranks(normally) nice communitySupports controllers!Heaps more diverse air-game compared to smash brosDecent tournaments on twitch and youtube, really good to learn combos and playstyles for different charactersButton at the end of the game that makes you say ggCons:Not all characters are unlocked and it takes a while to earn them, like in league of legendsHard learning curve on how to beat heavy spammersHattoriOnly three servers as of the start of 2016, EU, USA, and South East AsiaRequires alot of patience if you want to succeed in competitiveNot many weapons yet, I am very eager to see new possibilitiesSome characters become very op in certain patches, and can really mess up your elo\n",

      "Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n",

I just can't stop\n",
      "This game is broken. It brags a very realistic physics system. I think this was coded by a ♥♥♥♥ing monkey.But... if you can put up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game throws at you, its just a game you can laugh at with your friends.\n",
      "Now im going to start by saying this is not like minecraft at all. I have friends saying oh its minecraft but just 2D, IT'S NOT! Terraria adds a whole lot of new stuff that minecraft doesn't have. You can get some cool weapons, caves underground change according to what biome you are in and how deep down you are. At the end of each map there is a chest underwater where you can get some cool loot. One of the hardess things i found in this game was the blood moon. Now im going to spoil what it is but if you want to find out, you should buy the game for yourself.\n",
      "This is a game that i can not stop playing! I got it at the start of December and now im already tier 6 and level 33 after just a few hours of game play. You can build what ever come up in to your mind then put it out on the battle field. In battle you get 1 life and thats it, you can't respawn once you die. All you can do is watch and hope your team wins or go back to garage to fix up your ship a bit. The developers are super friendly by giving you codes at special times of the year for you to use in the game and get bouns! I would recommend it to any person as it is a fun, quick game.\n",
      "A good game but it seems that it would be more fun with friends\n",
      "Do you like pwning your friends with guns and other weapons? Exploding your foes and the enviroment? Dragon punching your enimies faces? Well you've come to the right place! In this game there are tons of weapons at your disposal to murder your friends or AI's. You will also be able to change the rules to your liking . This game is fun with friends!... or without...\n",
      "This is a great co-op game for up to six players. It's an online fps which allows you to kill monster alien mutations!It has great graphics and gamplay and also a hint of horror in the mixture. This game delivers players a thrill, crowding you in a monster mash of enemies hoarding towards you. Wave after wave different monsters appear with different abilities, similar to L4D2. Once you have completed all the waves you will be faced with the Patriarch, a powerful scientist mutation and the last resort to take you out. This game is best played with a friend or two, but just make sure they don't wield you into a room full of monsters...Sounds fun? Because it is. I recomend this to people who enjoy fps's and a bit of horror.\n",
      "Gun MonkeysDeveloped by: SIZE FIVE games“SIZE FIVE was rather inventively set up at the very peak of the Global Economic Meltdown by part-time Indie developer and full-time against-the-grain specialist Dan Marshall.“ The company develops games that arise under the Comedy genre. One of which, winning a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award. An incredible feat some might say!Gun Monkeys. Well…, I can honestly say I never thought I was going to see those two words in the same sentence. At first glance, I’d thought a game like this was a little absurd, 2 monkeys fighting in an arena, with guns. Nevertheless, the lovely team at “SIZE FIVE Games” sent me a couple of copies to hand around and spread the word (Thanks by the way!).Gun Monkeys is an intense, 2D side-scrolling, platform, and shooter. Gun Monkeys is basically a bunch of bad ♥♥♥ monkeys, competing against each other in a 1-on-1 battlefield. Each player has one core, the objective is to maintain your core for as long as you can by returning little power cubes to your core, or (preferred option), annihilating your foes in the arena with an assortment of weapons! If you forget to maintain your core and the power runs out, then your opposition becomes the winner and will proudly shoot your little monkey brains out anytime, vice versa.My personal experience playing the game was quite pleasant besides the fact that I got absolutely demolished in every round I played. The controls were confusing at first but after a couple of rounds, you get used to it. Graphics wise, the game itself is quite… “trippy”, as it features a lot of glowing colours and blurring, but this can be toned down in the options if you wish.   So, besides the oddly scaled matchmaking, I did enjoy jumping around the randomly generated arena’s, collecting different weapon crates and experimenting with the cool perks that the game allows you to purchase for your character. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a couple of fast-paced, 1 on 1, combat/shooter, arena matches with their friends. If you are going to buy this game, might I recommend buying a second copy for a mate just in case, as the servers are not always filled with people to play against. If you can’t find anyone online, the game also supports 2 players on the one keyboard for some local gaming. On a side note, the narrating of this game is hilarious!I hope you enjoyed reading my insight on Gun Monkeys, I had a blast playing it!Regards, Paul\n",
      "A thrilling multiplayer that actually creates a new sense of gameplay. It gives a somewhat new direction of mulitplayer experience while also feeling familar enough that you don't feel like you are playing Catan for the first time.Simple controls, nice little (could be bigger) weapons list, and as fiar as I have played expansive map collection. However I do feel like that is where the game could be a little lacking. And, there only seems to be a few downsides. Simply put; the selection of maps- that are quite literally the same, no singleplayer/training mode (or even first-timer newb mode bot game), and that NO ONE IS ON ANY SERVERS!Great game to put your rep on the line and battle it out with friends!\n",
      "Gameplay is fun. More balanced after Update 100. Make sure you have friends to play with or try making friends ingame. They apologize for the micro-transaction but they 'THOUGHT\" it was good for both the game and the community. This isn't right. The attitude isnt right.\n",
      "Orcs Must Die 2 is a great deffence game. I realy just ove that you have to build traps and troops t protect the rifts from the orcs. I much prefere Orcs Must Die 2 over the first one becuse i like how there is now multiplayer. If you have other friends with the game you can try to beat their high scores. But the only bad thing is that it is one of thoes games you might play once or twice then never play it again. I dont play it us much anny more but it is a good game to buy for the price even though it gets boring after a while.\n",
      "Play only with your friends. The community is suck.\n",
      "The only game where you can befriend a solitairy prisoner and sparta kick everything.10/10\n",
      "This game is basically crazy fun. You and up to 3 other friends plan a heist to rob banks, buildings, passports all to escape the country. Despite what you might think, the story is fairly well thought out. The gameplay is top notch, with one catch. In the top down view, the mechanics still work on line of sight. So you might be walking round a corner into the room of heavily armored goons. This catch makes for many historical and hilarious Friday night playthroughs of this game as you will be playing this game for hours on end. I recommend this to anyone who love a good thrill and want to try something different.\n",
      "When my friends ask me what a slig is, I will say oh it's one of the bad guys from the Abe series. About 20% of them wil say: \"oh those old games from the 90's\" but the rest will go \"what's abe\" then i'll have to say, look it up on steam. Abe was te very first game i ever played on my original playstation, back then though i could barely hold a contoller without dropping it, and i could still recognise this games fun potential. I believe just because a game is old and wasn't to popular when it first came out, isn't a  valid reason for a great puzzle platformer to fly under the radar. Abes Exodus, and Abes Odysee have an excellent backstory and lore, which come hand in hand with great, oldschool gameplay that gamers young and old can enjoy.-The Angry Slig\n",
      "Okay, I'll be blunt with you.Want some story?Want Edge of the field Graphics?How about some fantastic AI?Don't get this gameDo you want almost endless progression with hundreds of pieces of gear each for all 4 classes?Do you want great variety between each playstyle?Perhaps the massive number of mission and insane enemy variety?Actually, how about this- Do you want to have fun?Thats it, That is the single greatest feat this game has- its absolutely terrificly fun, it harkons to the error when a game cared for nothing but making sure you left with a smile on your face and a longing to try it again.While i'll mention the fact that this game is best played co-op (With up to 4 players) its still a hilarity on singleplayer, Everything from voice acting that sounds so absolutely wrong- yet is so right, The game is buggy and feels like a PS2 game, But everything bad about this game makes it so much better.Just buy it, Get your mates and buy it- The gameplay draws you in, You stay for the insanity and leave in a banquet of explosions and giant mech punching your friend into a skyscraper.Go on, buy it.\n",
      "Fun Game to pick up and play with some friends but not the type of game that you would really spend along sessons on, all and all it's a fun beat em up. 7/10\n",
      "Left4Dead2 is possibly one of my favourite games on steam and one I enjoy thoroughly when I play it with friends however whenever I've joined a community game if I've made even the slightest mistake people end up treating you like you're worse than trash. That is possibly the only negative about this game but I still hope that maybe some people who take the game too seriously will grow up and realise it is just that, a game, not a competition where you'll win prize money but a freaking game.\n",
      "Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.It is able to give you such a nice feeling after getting a kill even though you have no hitmarkers.In a nutshell - The game is just CS:GO with western gameplay and hatchets.But still ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!+ play with friends9/10\n",

But it is a game that you buy and you never stop playing its sooo much fun with friends. I would have done a larger review but that sound boring  :P lol so im giving it10/10 for being in my top 4 best games.\n",
      "I first played dota 2 in 2013 when a friend gave it to me. At first i didnot like it that much and thought it was quiet boring ( i also had no idea how to play) BUT in may 2015 i started giving it a second chance. I now LOVE IT dota 2 is so much fun with friends and very competieve and has a lot of characters to choose from with there own unique characteristics i think dota can a quite mean and abusive community at times but if u just ignore them your will have lots of fun i now have got the hang of the game now and play it all the time :) i give this                                                                                       10/10\n",

      "Valve took a small idea which they trialled in the Orange Box and made it a million times better. And it was already awesome. This game combines a complex story packed with deep themes, in the form of a difficult, but equally enoyable puzzle game. Put simply, it's a piece of artwork. You will have hours of enjoyment playing through the main story and freaking-out over every single plot detail. Then, you'll tell your friends how awesome this game is, wait for them to complete the story and finally spend many more hours playing the well-designed and equally challenging co-op mode. Valve may not be able to count to 3 yet, but they can definitely put out one hell of a 2.\n",
      "CSGO is a Salty game full of salty mofos and i would like to say, VALVE get a system where theres a reason to kick a player out of the game. Thats the only thing i ask because when your not qued/ing with friends, (begginers in competitve) they will get kicked for a stupid reason and since ive gotten kicked even though i was carrying and we were about to win my whole team kicked me so ♥♥♥♥ them and i hope VALVE reads this and puts like system. PEACEAnd if u think im SALTY CHECK AUSTRALIA they are much saltyer then i am\n",

The game runs surprisingly smooth for what it's worth, and as for the humour, if you enjoy laughing at a blindsided robot falling off a cliff, a maniac exclaiming that he has a finger pizza for you or anything along those lines, you're needed here in Borderlands 2.Onto who you'll actually be! Whether you choose to be an ex-army Commando, a mystical Siren, a strongman Gunzerker, a number, a schoolgirl Mechromancer or Meat Bicycle Man, you're going to have a ton of fun. As long as you have a friend, good times are to be had for sure!But then you go on, \"Portable Toaster, do I look like the guy who'd have friends?\" Oh. Uh. Well, you can play solo, I guess. I'll just put this out there, though, I was given control of the vehicle by my friend and as soon as he got in, I ran off a cliff accidentally. Honest. But there is fun to be had in Single-Player. Don't worry if you have friends who can't afford the game, you'll still have a blast. But the real fun is with a few silly mates.9.5/10 definite buy.\n",
      "this game looks awesome i very much recomend this and it is great with friends\n",
      "Lying around with a bunch of invading phantoms while the host throws prism stones all around us in celebration of our new friendship....lovely\n",
      "This game should be boring... but it isn't, When I first received this game as a gift I pretty much scoffed at the idea of the game, cleaning up messes, sounds so boring. But its brilliant and can cause so much frustration. Imagine spending hours cleaning a facility every little bit and taking your final bucket of filthy water for disposal...then you drop the f**king bucket and then step in it and spread filth everywhere... so infuriating. This game when played with friends is a nightmare, you clean an area only for your friendto abscent mindedly walk filth through it... you wish there was a button to beat them to death with the mop. I definitely recommend.\n",
      "As a single player campaign this game is pretty average. The sniping mechanics are pretty well implemented and getting a perfect headshot factoring in both the wind and bullet drop leaves you feeling somewhat accomplished. Where this game is at its best is the multiplayer. I'd like to use an example; 5 minutes left in a 20 minute round neither player has gotten a kill or seen one another, all of a sudden a sniper sight reflects the sunlight \"BANG\" a bullet sails past your head and you realise the other player hasn't aimed effectively, you quickly aim your sight - aimed slightly above and to the right of the head \"BANG\" perfect headshot 386m. You feel like a complete badass. The multiplayer in this feels like an actual challenge as opposed to the quick and mostly forgettable multiplayer seen in other games such as the C.O.D series.I recommend this as a game to play multiplayer with friends but not really as a campaign that needs to be played. So maybe wait until it's on sale or something.\n",
      "My friends think i'm the biggest warmongering son of a gun out there. Some people call me a terrorist. I like to think of myself as a techer. They cower behind their embaroing and diplomacy I prefer the title as an opportunnist. 10/10\n",
      "This game is an interesting piece of... something. I would say that it's a bad game, mostly because it's trying to be a horror game and it isn't, it's extremely overpriced, the graphics range from okay to eye-bleedingly bad, has way too many bugs and the story is extremely hard to follow. BUT. Even though it really doesn't feel like a Resident Evil game, I'd hate to say it, but the co-op is sort of fun. I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome. So... I give this game a recommendation.\n",
      "Full of friendly friends, seriously, don't worry. they're all friends, don't run from them, just hug them, so many commas in this sentence, hug them, please.(BUT ACTUALLY THOUGH GOOD GAME 8/10 GOOD AND SPOOKY)\n",

This will literally wreck your mind. I LOVE IT!! The feeling of finally dieing is a mixture of \"YES! I FINALLY DIED!'\" and \"How the f**k did I not think of that...\".  It involves getting cut up by saws, getting cut up by spikes and getting squashed by boxes. REMEMBER YOU CAN GET SQUASHED BY BOXES OR YOU WILL RAGE. This game makes me so angry. Get. Before 9 March. Only 14 cent. Also Dead Bits. Get.\n",

      "Amazing game 11/10Would reccomend a few things though.1. Make sure you have a computer with at least 3Ghz of processing power (Do this by using dxdiag in your run)2. Possibly make trebuchets launch. Looks like its going to be added soon.3. Add multiplayer. Because its just 10x better with friends.Overall you need a really good computer to render the world better and I would strongly reccomend adding the two fetures in otherwise its a less engaging experience for players.Thank you Keen Software House for another great game! :)\n",
      "Warframe is a fun game you can play with your friends or spend long nights playing it by yourself, the combat is usually very fast paced and ridiculous (in a good sense). There are some issues though - Sometimes in levels you spend WAY too long running around. The gameplay can get very repetitive and boring, and for a beginner it's extremely hard to learn how to play as the shop and item system is quite complex.\n",
      "This was the first ever game i got on steam. Let me say, Its still as Entertaining now!.It's the final capstone of the Dawn of War series, and It does it's job.It has a mostly Rich Campaign that was well thought out, has a degree of difficulty, and makes sense.Now, It's not as RTS'ish as the first dawn of war games, however it's kind of evolved to feel more like tabletop.Good points:A Choice of three characters per army in multiplayer.Each multiplayer faction (Eldar, Space Marines, Orks, Tyranids, Chaos Space marines, Imperial Guardsmen) Has a trio of unique Heroes to use to represent you In-game. Mostly, These \"Generals\" Fall into: Offense, Defense, Support. There are also Stealth and Teleportation heroes, but they are fewer than those three.>IMPERIAL GUARDImperial Guard has The Inquisitor as offense, The Commissar lord as Support, and the Lord General as Defense.THE INQUISITORThe Inquisitor mostly focuses on PURGE EVERYTHING WITH FIRE, and she does it well. Her main weapon wargear gives her abilities to combat small amounts of powerful foes, and large amounts of less-thans with relative ease. She does however fall off against tanks and super-heavies a little, but, I mean come on.THE COMMISSAR LORD.The Commissar lord focuses around boosting nearby squads, and nearby squads boosting him. Sound a bit cryptic? Well, A certain peice of wargear he can get boosts his health regeneration depending on how many nearby friendly squads there are. Other than this, he is also superior for demoralizing and debuffing enemy troops. Reducing damage output, Tankability ETC. Unfortunatly, He too suffers against tanks and Superheavies...Not looking good for Guardsmen, Huh?THE LORD GENERAL.So, the other two fall off against tanks and superheavies? WELL HERE IS REDEMPTION. The lord general is Followed by a personal squad, that get the same weapon as he does. Upgrade him with flamer? Burn all the troops. Upgrade with melta? Astala♥♥♥♥off tanks. On this topic, when you give him a meltagun, he gains the ability to turn nearby allies' gun cooldown to 0. Gun Cooldown? Wtf does that mean? It's basically the \"Reload\" of a gun, or the time between bursts that a gun fires. Hence, it has no boost on flamers...But on autocannons that fire basicallly miniature rockets?~>SPACE MARINESWelcome to the Fanboy's wet dream. The space marines have a Captain for offense, Apothecary for \"Healing\". and techmarine for Defense.THE CAPTAINWelcome to the all you can eat anti-everything extraveganza!. He's basically a Glorified sargent who can be upgraded to specialise against everything. That not enough for you? WELL THEN LOOK NO FURTHER. He can be upgraded into Tactical Dreadnaught armor, AKA Terminator armor, which takes away most of his options of weapons and stuff, But, as the name suggests, gives you a hell of a lot of resistance. While in termy armor, you can equip an Assualt cannon, good against heavy troops, a heavy flamer, Good against light troops, and twin power claws, good against anything.THE APOTHACARYAs his name, and specialty suggests, The Apothacary's strength lies in his ability to keep units, and even allied heroes, alive. When giving the Sanguine chainsword and put with a personal squad of assualt terminators, this guy just wont go down easily. His global abilities also allow him to revive allied heroes from anywhere on the map!...Pretty nifty.THE TECHMARINENot really much to see here, he's kind of just your normal defense-archtype. can build turrets and ♥♥♥♥, and is fairly tanky.>CHAOS SPACE MARINESThe Chaos space marines! Mine, and my best friend's personal favorite. For Offense, They have the mighty Chaos lord, For Defense, The Putrid Plague Champion, and for Support, The...Sorceror.THE CHAOS LORD.This guy is the biggest cheese around. You know how i said terminator armor was an upgrade for the captain? WELL THIS GUY GETS IT FREE. He has superior Anti-hero capability, and all around Anti-EVERYTHING. Unfortunatly, i havent played him much, so i cant tell you much more than that.THE PLAGUE CHAMPION.This guy is my Bro. While the apothacary can keep his guys alive, this guy can simultainiously do that, kill enemies, and give toughness auras. Not only this, but his anti-infantry capability is absolutely amazing. He is capable of destroying 5 squads of guardsmen with a single DoT grenade!. Alongside this, He also give global abilities to boost this further, like making a highly damaging cloud that tears through Squads, and an ability that once enemies die, they come back for a little bit as MO♥♥♥♥ING ZOMBIES. THE SORCERORThis guy is just \"♥♥♥♥ your turrets.\" Normally, you'd have to waste a few guys flanking base turrets. With this badass, you can teleport him behind their turrets, and then use a global to bring EVERY UNIT YOU CONTROL. TO HIM. Ez.13zTHE ELDARThis...Is actually getting boring quickly, and i'm still on the first good point...Can i stop now? :sAnyway: Other good points:Story mode and multiplayer are amazing, and have few bugs.Last stand, despite a few bad points, Is actually the reason i love this game.Bad points: Last stand has lots of bugs, and some characters have very little background. And thats it.GG.\n",

      "Well if you looking for a game with terrible gameplay, cliche story and the most uninteresting characters ever created.......THEN YOUR IN THE WRONG PLACE. This game is a masterpeice and deserves all the praise its been getting. The gameplay is extremely unique since it mixes jrpg elements with bullet hell, (this was a brilliant idea). ALL the characters are extremely interesting, i dont think i came across one enemy that i thought was boring this can also be said for the MUSIC. The music in this game, OMG where do i start, the music is AMAZING and clearly has had a lot of time put into creating the perfect tune for each encounter. Oh by the way the game is extremely funny and is self realised, from every little joke made at almost averything you interact with. Undertale surprisingly has a really in depth morality system that will remember EVERYTHING you did in your playthrough. This effects greatly how the story will play out and even goes on to shape how your next run will go.Now heres where the game hooks you the most.THE FEELSI dont think ive ever been as emotionaly scared. Undertale does a Brilliant job at making you feel like what your doing matters. From showing mercy and making friends with EVERYONE to being a completely psychopathic murderer. oh and if you thought that you can just reset the game and try again if you, say accidentally kill someone, well your going to have a bit of a surprise when you run into them again (thats all i'm goint to say).And yes this game has great replay value since there are multiple endings (That are actually vastly different from each other). So overall this game is a MUST BUY. trust me you wont regret it.\n",

      "I have played warframe for much longer now and my feelings about it have vastly improved. Since last reviewing this I have continued to improve and have found myself enjoying the game so much more. Warframe feels like a home, the game I always come back to after playing other games and it always has something to offer me.At this current time I own at least one of every warfame, either primed or non-primed versions, and have enjoyed playing them all. Note that most of my game experience has been had while playing as either Excalibur, Volt Prime or Frost Prime.I feel now that warframe is not only greatly customisable, and still Improving, that I feel I can now specialise myself in different ways. All my loadout slots have a speciality or an archetype. You may say I'm limiting myself but this is how I choose to play. I said in my original review that there wasn't quite enough to specialise in, but I now feel otherwise.Something that feels perfect to me now is Warframe is getting more cinematic and lore friendly quests, mainly beginning with Natah, and I feel as though there is a much better narrative to the game, that while I did not feel it was required, I do love the addition of.The pay model is my favourite thing as it is basically \"Pay if you are not patient\" as it still seems to me that you can get everything you want, save maybe a few cosmetic items, by just playing the game and knowing where to be and when.To my favourite point about this game, Digital Extremes is still keeping me, personally, hyped. Usually what they add is something that I have been thinking \"Warframe would be so cool if it had X\" for example the upcoming weapon sheathing customisation. While a small thing to mention it does make me excited for almost every update, the only one letting me down being Sands of Inaros, but following such a big update as The Second Dream this couldn't really be avoided.Pros:A great game to play aloneA great game to play with friendsFantastic customisation to warframes and their coloursFun WeaponsFun WarframesEasy enough for new gamersChallenging enough for veteransCons:Conclave can be toxic (I do not blame DE for this one)Dark Sector as they are now, and as it seems they are to becomeNew Warframes appear to be stagnating slightlyOverall I reccomend Warframe to try, while it may take a while to really feel it you will feel like this game is everything you want. It's a love it or hate it game I say. Well done DE, well done.\n",
      "What at first seemed like a promising new addition to the 4X genre turned out to be a complete disaster.The game is incomplete and the devs have since jumped ship to rebuild the game from scratch under a separate title, \"Stardrive 2\". No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.As for the specific issues with the game:PROS-1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.CONS-1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can't do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn't appear to have any strategic element either.5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn't say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their \"new\" game.'nuff said.Such a pity, really. This game had so much promise....\n",

      "Great MMORPG. For me, it was my first experience with a game like this. Mainly because it was 3D. :3 Don't judge me. Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages. I have friends playing this game from as young as 10 to 30 xD. 8.5/10 Great combat and story.\n",

      "EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Posted: 24 MayThis game is garbage. If you manage to run a successful private server with friends, you\\'ll enjoy it. Otherwise, you\\'re entering a poorly optimized, grief prone fiesta. The developers are too focused on content release than to focus on fixing the problems of their game. I\\'m going to lay it out for you clearly and easily.Griefing --Ark is a game where you build bases in a sandbox and your body stays in the game after you logout. This isn\\'t a unique concept, as it shares this attribute with games like Rust. However, Ark also attempts to interblend a dinosaur aspect which it fails at miserably. The reason why is because of the exponential growing curve required to succeed in this game. Exponential Growing Curve --As you advance in the game, you require more and more minerals and resources for your items. However, dinosaurs gather this tremendously faster. If you want to tame a high level dinosaur, you need to have many hours dedicated to taming (hours. You read that right), and many resources to keep the dinosaur unconscious. If you manage to endure the glitches, bugs, spawns, griefers, and finally tame such dinosaur, you\\'re rewarded with gameplay boons unimaginable. HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS.A tribe on a server, through time and merely time alone, become near unstoppable due to the simple aspect of this curve. If you\\'re gathering metal by hand, attempting to make metallic weaponries in your twenties, and the elder tribe is gathering at a rate, and I\\'m not joking you, 1000% your speed, you\\'re going to have a dilemma. Mind you if this tribe decides to be a grief tribe and patrol the skies with high level avian creatures, you have little to no way to fight way.This is directed at new tribes establishing on servers.-- The Time SinkArk is such an invested Time Sink. You have to play for hours and hours to get over the grind. If someone plays longer than you, they\\'re going to beat you. It doesn\\'t matter what you say, or what you think. They\\'ll reach the curve first and outpace your technology.This game is so terribly flawed I\\'m not even sure why people enjoy this ♥♥♥♥. Mind you, IF YOU DECIDE TO PLAY ON A PVE SERVER, you STILL Have to deal with griefers in the form of land claiming, as they place useless pillars all over the ♥♥♥♥ing map because the developers are too inept to disable this, or find a better way to make this work.I have 630 hours on this game. I\\'ve played way back when, recently, and presently. I\\'ve conquered servers before exploiting this, and I\\'ve been conquered. THE GAME. IS NOT WORTH. YOUR FRUSTRATION.When the developers clean up their act, maybe give it a shot then. Until then, don\\'t waste your time.\n",
      "Brilliant Game, very fun and very diverse in game modes. Most servers have co-operative Admins and friendly players.Avoid any servers called: Quarantine Gaming - They are corrupt and will attempt to convince you to donate to them, poor sod, this kid Batman is so guillible, I quote \"My parents are horrible they won't let me donate money...\" seriously? Anyway the Owner Bob Dylan (Avoid this guy) went on to try and convince the kid to ask more and more, of course I think this is apalling so I step in and tell Bob Dylan to back off and explain to Batman the reason why his parents don't want him donating his money (keep in mind this kid is around 10 years old so his grasp on reality is pretty dodgy), anyway the QG|Bob Dylan bans me for this.So sorry for my rant, but there isn't really a better way to tell everyone, but yeah Gmod is excellent.\n",
      "This game is no doubt, the greatest 2D Sandbox game of all time. This was my very first game on steam and it was definitely worth getting it.There are 21 bosses in the game from what I remember and tons of weapons you could get. You can fight monsters, build anything, and explore! You can join in your friends' worlds and team up together to defeat the bosses.In my opinion, I would recommend this game for people from ages 8 and above.The game is also available on iOS, Android and Console (XBOX, PS3).10/10\n",

Yes it has FPS lag on a few maps like Defender or Instict but only for a minute or two,after that the game is fine.-The new Exo-Suits give you to do things that you couldn't have done in the previous C.O.D's.Like for example dont you hate it when you get shot in the back?Well with this COD you just Boost Jump your way out of it!-There is a fair aresenal of weaponry that you can use in the game,with new weapons like the MORS,RW1,HBRA3 ect. with some old classics like the AK12,MP44 GRACH (Pistol),Bulldog etc.-You Can now prestige 15 times not 10!-This game is heeps of fun with some friends in a private,online match,or just on your own playing online!-Storyline is AMAZING!-Bunch of new gamemodes like Uplink,Momentum Etc.-I Really recommend this game! \n",

      "I downloaded Race The Sun for free when I saw my friend playing it. I am glad I did. The game is stunning and very addictive. I have intalled it on my school laptop to play in spare time. Race the sun is a great time killing game. A game to play after a hard day.\n",

      "This is a fun, not well known fighting game. It has a range of fighters and weapons and lots of weapons and masks in the steam workshop. It's really fun to play with friends!\n",
      "This is a really fun game, but it can be frustrating at times. This game never stops providing challenges to the player. There are a range of bikes and costumes for your racer! It also has a level editor, so you can make your own maps and publish them for other players to download. This game is also fun when playing with friends.\n",
      "There are games that do certain things better but imo this is the best overall. I mainly played GT series on PS before pCars. Anyone that says you can't play with M&K or controller is just being an idiot you can play fine with them. Pros:The best racing game I've played in terms of:Graphics,Sound,Tracks.Cons:Lack of cars,AMD runs poorly on Ultra (just turn particles to low, fixed it for my friend at least.)\n",
      "Fantastic game. My friends and I had a blast on 4 player coop. Absolutely amazing that they'd making this amazing game and release it for free!\n",
      "This game.... is amazing.It has all of my favourite RPG characteristics; Extensive character creation, unique experiences, story-changing choices and much much more. It also has more realistic parts, for example: marriage (both heterosexual and homosexual), granted Bethesda copped some flack for Oblivion's heterosexual-only marriage, but it is still good to see homosexual marriage in the game.One of my favourite aspects of this game, is the fact that everyone has their own unique experience. Both me and my friend can talk about Skyrim all day and we willl always have different experiences.There are two minor (and cliché) problems that I have with Skyrim: 1)  It has no multiplayer; Skyrim would be even better if it had multiplayer. To quote M'aiq the Liar (Main easter-egg guy) : \"Some like taking friends on adventures. M'aiq thinks being alone is better. Less arguing about splitting treasure.\"  But none the less, I can live without multiplayer.2) As Skyrim is a huge open-world game, it has a little more bugs than any other game. But those can be fixed (usually).If you are considering buying this game, then buy it. It is (in my opinion) one of the most immersive, fascinating and addictive games ever. I spent all Summer playing this game. So I recommend this RPG to anyone.~DarthHaydo1\n",

      "Great game but has many issues due to the poor console port by Rockstar. I feel this could run better if it was developed properly and not rushed/ported.Edit: You could end up like me having 200 hours on this game because it is sooooo fun.Recommended mods: Simple native trainer 6.4, HD texture packs, enb mods, various .asi mods such as prone, gunequip etc. Just so much fun with friends or randoms :D\n",
      "Incredible ship building/space shooting game.I am a big fan of space shooters and the fact that you are able to build a whole FLEET of your own ships is amazing. However, the agents in the game is really a party foul when your travelling in space. For me at least, they would block my path to a worm hole and i kept getting shot down. I understand that you are supossed to grind and build better ships but the difficulty of the agents are too damn high...Overall, this is very very VERY good game. Hopefully, they will be adding more playable matches and even a multiplayer mode where friends can work together  in the same fleet and conquer the universe.\n",
      "I find the game CAN be fun with friends but the AI is so bad, the zombies walk through objects so often\n",
      "This game is perhaps one of the best games i've ever played. On single player the game challenges the player and it's a lot of fun but multiplayer playing with a friend is twice as good. I definately recommend the game to all different types of players, It's 1st person, a shooter and a zombie survival. AWESOME IN A GAME\n",

      "Playing this game makes me feel like I'm playing a side-scrolling version of \"System Shock 2\". It's themes and RPG system are roughly similar to it, and that's what draws me in.Love the 2-dimensional side-scrolling aspect. Love the cyberpunk theme. Love the top-down shooter hacking interface. Love the easy stealth/take-down aspect.If you love these things as well, you really need to give \"DEX\" a try.Just be wary of some things:1) Playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller is fine for the general gameplay. But when making the transition from general gameplay to the Cyberspace/AR interface, make sure you have a trusty keyboard nearby.2) The gunplay function can be your friend or your enemy. Train yourself with the controls, particularly when using a controller. You may even find that your fists work more efficiently over any gun you come across.3) Be wary of your surroundings. Everything with a health bar or blinking light could, and probably will, kill you.4) Mature content. Expect ANYTHING a back alley would normally have.Other than that, I recommend this game to all.\n",

      "I wanted to like this game soo much, I have easily exceeded 500 hours on borderlands 2 but this uh it's just not as good.Honestly I have tried to find good things to say about it in order to recommend it to friends but I just can't, the storyline is okay, not as good as borderlands 2 but it has a few funny lines and is still better than your average fps, the visuals while being essentially the same as the 2cnd just fail to capture any real variety -essentially the same area recycled over and over and over again.The characters are more inline with borderlands 1 and the trees go back to being a slight dps increase rather than a playstyle definer. But playstyle is the true casualty here. The combat from the 2cnd game heck even the first has been taken out, stripped for parts, ♥♥♥♥♥ with a hammer than lazily slopped back in -easily the worst of the franchise their is no variation u have to go in guns blazing full board with no other option. enemy ai will not allow for control or long range options they will charge your position or grenade spam and their is nothing u can do about it -cover is worthless this time round and any slam or grenade hits will send you flying due to gravity.Gravity is the absolute worst mechanic ever introduced into a fps, it ruins everything it touches in this game, the lack of atmosphere makes exploration painful and not worth the effort, the use of said atmo in combat and the forced nature of its use is just extra frustration, the jump mechanics to get it to work can be fiddly and again frustrating with fire being able to knock u out or lock u into a low burn so very easily. the slightest hit with a nade or slam will throw u from cover and often off of cliffs or walls -into hazards etc with nothing u can do about it. lunatics this games versions of psycos especially can just be a pain to deal with as they rush ur position and spam ground slams.Vehicles, this game introduces 2 new ones and they are shocker -absolutely terrible, the game throws ALOT of vehicle jumps at u especially early on but the first car can barely make any of them and will often just zoom straight off into the beyond -the game gives u the 2cnd vehicle early and while it can make the jumps its this lame as slow wanna be bike or speeder thing -just soo much fail.Finally the laser weapons -my god f the damn laser weapons -in a players hands they are terrible ammo horing weapons dealing little damage per ammo but in the enemy hands they will rend your sheilds and health faster than a rocket round, the ai is extremelly acurate as they are in all borderlands and these enemies can fly and manipulate the gravity it's just frustration to deal with them with all the other factors in play.\n",
      "The gross out humor, political wit and just about every form of negative sterotyping is in full south park swing so if you don't like south park avoid this game, if you do despite a relatively short exp you will be replaying this game for days finding all the referances and nods to the show.As an rpg it stands up very well, playing very similiar to paper mario with a mature twist to the attack styles, visualy it looks like it was cut dierectly from the tv show which is actually pretty impressive and the story is fantastic even if some of the scenes go a bit too far but hey thats south park :3.There is a anti-censer patch in the forums and if you have no friends in america that can buy then gift it to you I would strongly recommend downloading and installing it.  The glitches that plagued launch are near enough all gone now and I've only encountered 1 during my time playing anyway.once again if you love south park this game is a must have, if you can't sit through a episode then give this a skip as the southpark style is in full swing throughout.\n",

      "Portal 2 is the sequel to the puzzle game, Portal, which showed off revolutionary gameplay mechanics, along with great storytelling. Portal 2 builds upon the first game's storyline. You play as Chell, a test subject at Aperture Laboritories, where instead of using a normal gun, you must utilise the Portal Gun, which creates two connected points in space.This game really knows how to create a great story. When the game starts, a sphere / droid thingie called Wheatley saves you from your room and takes you with him to try and escape Aperture, only to awaken GLaDOS. The interactions between GLaDOS are really witty and funny, with great voice acting.The puzzles themselves are very good. The mechanic of the portal, along with some very clever test elements (such as lasers, gels and turrets) are fun to work with. Almost every test chamber has a new way of solving something. However, the puzzles don't get overly hard, they mostly stay around the medium difficulty mark.With this sequel there is now a coop mode, where you play with a friend as either Atlas or P-Body. This mode is a elcome edition, and the servers run smoothly, save for the occasional disconnect. The witty GLaDOS dialogue is still there, although now she's comparing the two bots, insulting them and even pitting them against eah other. The puzzles are still fun, and in most cases are harder than the main game. Cooperating is half the batlle, but this is helped by good microphone support and the 'ping' tool, which is used to mark locations.Now that the new upate is in, new features have been added. There is now a time-trial mode for the single player and multiplayer modes, which is like a built in feature for speedrunners, where you can check your friend's times, as well as the world's. This works well, in my opinion. I haven't encountered any errors, though getting into a multiplayer time trial game is pretty hard. Also, there is now a level editor! This is really easy to use, and yet beautifully complex. The menus are a bit fiddly though. Complex and challenging puzzles can and have been made and uploaded to the Steam Workshop, though a lot of these gems are surrounded by mindless garbage and maps that aren't even puzzles that somehow reach the front page.All in all, I would recommend this game to any player of any skill level. Portal 2 is a puzzle game with tons of content and replayability.+ Level editor!+ Great puzzles and puzzle elements+ Fun coop mode+ Time Trail mode's a great edition- Can be buggy9.5 / 10TL; DR: Buy it now.\n",
      "Its a great game i like it a lot its fun to play alone or white friends if you buy this game and play online plz dont hack no one likes hacker :D I ♥ starbound\n",
      "7/10Positives would be basically you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing space ship! First of all. Secondly great array of blocks, alien creatures (friendly or foe), great mystery when exploring civilisations and of course love the fact that you can choose to eliminate or friend civilsations and trade etc with them / steal all their ♥♥♥♥. Although an early release game is going to have its flaws as Starbound is only in Alpha, major improvements are required. Such as a better variety and significantly increased civilisations that you stubble upon on planets. The game is based on exploration and I find that after a while it becomes boringly repeatitve, especially when you keep finding the same or similar civilisations on differing planets. I'd also suggest more underground finds, or possibly even hidden underground civilisations, just something to encourage players to explore underground more, instead of just venturing down for ores. Definitately needs to have more craftable 'bricks' to build with. At the moment its only possible to craft 'Cobblestone' or 'Steel' (Beta stage) bricks, especially due to the small ship space players are supplied with, it makes building a base on the 'Home Planet' inevitable. Of course this problem is solved by some awesome ship mods, but in game I think they're should be an option to inprove and expand your ship as you advance in Starbound.\n",

      "A Must-Buy game. Pumping Iron, clipping guards and taking your clothes off and running around the prison whilst guards are chasing you are only a few things that make up The Escapists.What makes this game so worth your 10 bucks? First of all, it's pixelated. If you're like me, pixelated games will make your heart melt like butter on pancakes. Secondly, it has that sandbox feel, but also a prison architect kind of security system, topped off with humourous remarks and a reason to do everything.It's extremely PC-space friendly as it only takes a mere 18mb to run. You can still enjoy the game whether its your first time playing, or if you had already completed the game more than 10 times. Let me recap : Whats good :-Extremely addictive.-Space friendly.-Indie.-PIXELATED!-Sandbox-y?-Challenging, as well as entertaining.-Humorous Interaction.-Different types of weapons/contraband.-Can get naked.-Only 9.99!What needs improvent:-Music, I turned it off after an hour or so.-Like to see this become co-op.-Characters get buggy occasionally.This game has lots of potential, and it's only in early acess! What are you waiting for? Buy it, damnit!\n",
      "This game has something going for it,  mainly for Runescape friendly players. Personally, I've been looking for games similar to RS, and this has been the closest so far. However, the servers are extremely laggy for me. Everytime I enter an area, my game freezes for about 5-20 seconds, and frees itself up again. After about 5 more seconds, the whole screen crashes. The issue with the crashes is that Steam still senses me as In-Game, and I can still hear music. However, I cannot end the application with Task Manager, only able to close the game once and for all with a computer restart.Looking past the horrendous lag, I can see more people growing a love for the game, as it gives the freedom to shape and mould your character into whatever class you want. I would certainly play it once again if the server lag and crashes are fixed. 4/10\n",
      "A whole new 2 dimensional world that allows you to do whatever you want. Highly reccomend this game, will be sending some copies to my friends.\n",
      "Ok, so let me start by saying I do enjoy this game a lot, but I (and im sure many others) would like it a lot better if there were more dino's and possibly even more weapons, but I'm not too fussed about it.GAMEPLAYtheHunter: Primal is a hunting game. So don't go into it expecting to be able to kill the dino's, cook their meat and eat it, or be able to build a shelter. This game is a survival game, but not in the sense like the forest or stranded deep. I haven't played the normal theHunter game so I'm not sure if this game has the same mechanics, but i do enjoy the tracking system, and the ability to use stealth to your advantage to either hunt or get away from a dino. The game has no plot or storyline which does make it a bit boring for those people who expect to have an overall mission. 8/10 for gameplay.THE MAPThe world that this game is set on is visually stunning (if you have a decent computer) and is actually really big, so you can spend a lot of hours just navigating your way around the map and discovering the different environments which in itself is enjoyable. The addition of settlements is great because they can provide players with a goal or shelter. 10/10 for the map.MULTIPLAYERThis game is pretty much just a multiplayer game. There is no point even bothering to play singleplayer because you will die. I am yet to play on a PvP server because personally I find it more enjoyable to hunt with others, not against them. This game is meant for friends to actually play together and take down a rex, which is why you can buy it in a 4-pack. You will find people even in PvE servers that will backstab you and take your stuff, but you will find even more people that will help you survive if you are a new player ( I have helped multiple new player get to a settlement and get some gear). 8/10 for multiplayer.DINO AI, SPAWNRATE AND HITBOXESOk, so this is defeniatly the biggest issue that the game has. The AI for most of the dino's is really annoying and is kinda dumb (they are working on improving this though). The spawnrate of dino's is actually reasonably good at the moment, and pretty much all old players will know of the problems created by some updates (When they increased the rex spawn rate so you couldn't walk through a field without seeing 10 rexes, and the Quetz update where you couldn't walk though a field without being dropped to your death). The hitboxes at the moment are terrible and gotta be fixed. I have been picked up by quetz's when i am standing 10 feet on either side of it, and bitten by Utahraptors even when I sidestep them. 6/10 for the AI, spawnrate and hitboxesOVERALL VERDICTOverall, i would defeniatly recommend this game for people looking for a game which provides a good teamwork experience, and are looking to make friends while hunting dino's (it's a win-win if you ask me). I would tell people that want a game where they can just jump in and start spraying dino's to look somewhere else.8/10 rating for the whole game.\n",
      "(Anyone not interested in backstory, skip to next paragraph) Well... I have a lot to say about this game. Two years ago, as a person who was sick of all the physics builders where you build something extremely fragile and watch it crash into a wall and explode, I was looking for something new and different. One day, I turned Steam on, and in the daily feed that always pops up, I saw a new game had just been released on Steam called Robocraft. Immediately interested, I downloaded the game and found myself in literally exactly what I had been looking for ever since I first discovered Minecraft, a battle arena game where you build your contestants literally from scratch. The devs actively published new updates that improved the game, and for a good year, Robocraft was the best - and only - game I ever routinely played. A lot has changed since then.-The devs released this game with the intentions of keeping it as not only a free-to-play (F2P) game, but a free to win game as well, one where nothing that actually altered the gameplay would be locked behind paywalls. This is one of the issues I would like to talk about. The old system had you earning a certain amount of RP, the currency previously used, that you could spend on pretty much anything except for cosmetic parts, which didn't affect gameplay at all. You earned a decent amount from playing, and each day, all of your bots in each garage (before, you started with 3 garages and had to pay for more) would have a 2x multiplier on your score from your first victory each day with each bot. This system allowed you to get what you wanted when you wanted it. Now, with the crate drop system, your hard earned winnings are completely randomized. One day you could get essentially nothing, the next you could get the rarest items in crate after crate. This system has more or less been fine with the endgame players and beginners, but the \"middle class\" of players - those who had been playing for a little while and were working their way up - got hit hard. You need a tank track to finally complete that bot, but don't have enough Robits to forge one? Too bad, you got a hover blade or some cubes. That's not even mentioning the horrible, and broken, economy (check the subreddit, one of my friends posted an explanation on how the system is broken).-The roboshop has also ruined the game. Once, if you wanted a great bot, you had to make it yourself or at least build it from the ground up with a guide, both of which taught you a lot on how to build a robot. But now, you can buy an overpowered bot from the shop without lifting a finger. This massively destroys the whole feel of the game, as you aren't forced to learn how to make a bot better, cause if it isn't, you can just dismantle it and buy a new one.-Finally, the devs aren't listening to their community. They claim that the game is forged from the community's feedback, but if it was, Epic Loot wouldn't exist, or at least would be made with a much better economy. If you don't get what you want from a crate, you can simply reforge it! ...or so was the idea. Let's use a legendary as example. To buy a Mega SMG, it costs 125,000 Robits. To sell one, on the other hand, you would only get 31,250. Meaning it would take you 4 mega SMG's, among the hardest items to randomly get in the game, to make 1. What kind of economy is that?!-TL;DR: Robocraft used to be good. The tiers more or less worked, at least better than it does now, we didn't have or even want some of the items we do now, and the economy is not only bad, but also broken. The devs need to start listening to their community and bending the game to how the players want to play. My advice? Wait. Don't get the game as it is now, and see if the devs finally change it to be fun as it used to be.\n",
      "It's a decent mod, it has a good community that makes great content. The only problem I have with it is calling it a game. Garry's Mod is a mod of Valve's Half-Life 2. Garry Newman, the man behind the mod, decided to make a map, put some tools in, copy and paste content from the Half-Life 2 folder and call it a game. I remember when this game was 20.00$ back when it looked interesting enough to check out, but with only being a kid with no money, and having a father who doesn't trust buying things on the internet, I was out of luck, so about 2 years later when I had my own card to buy the game with, it felt like the first time kissing a girl, amazing. After everything was all set, actually playing the game, and figureing out how to play was a pain in the as*s. Then, with a website full of content that other people made, and not knowing how to install said downloaded content, was all the more frustrating. Then the big 13 update came along with the workshop so the communnity could hold the mod's hand the whole time, just one problem, the whole game changed so nothing that I learned sinked, all the new features made no sense to a normal player such as my self. To sum it all up, if you want to play this game and have any actual fun, you have to Have no life and learn how to use every feature in the game. If you want to play Multiplayer you have the pleasure of being ♥♥♥♥♥ by doushbag admins, along with having to tollerate ear shattering sounds of little kids crying in the process, while your bing anally destroyed, as the old saying goes, the only winning move is not to play. The only reason to get this mod is to mess around with the Team Fortress 2 stuff, that's why I have it. If you don't have it, and your deciding to buy it or not, if someone tells you that it's something worth trying out, the person your talking to is not your friend, it's probably someone who has Garry's di*ck 1.54 inches in their as*s, probably Milfof6D9. Take it from someone with a life, job, and on the search for games worth playing on Steam, this mod is not worth the time.\n",

      "I am in the middle with this game( Don't get me wrong I love it but so many flaws) on this game I mean it's a tremendously welcome game for pretty much anyone. But Turtle Rock Studios screwed us over with this game if you look down you can't see your lower body and there isn't any servers that aren't modded in any God forsaken way and don't get me started with the community all they ever  do is kick me for having a vocalizer or if I screw up once in versus. And then there is the L4D1 map ports I would love to be able to see the melee weapon on the L4D1 characters(Without mods) but no I guess they magically float in your intestine. And then there is the person that thinks it's a good idea to team kill everyone.

      "Don't Starve is already a fun game with many intricate game mechanics, so Klei creating a multiplayer version was a brilliant idea. If you have \"Not Starved\" before in single player imgaine trying to do that while supporting friends at the same time. Another good feature about multiplayer is that multiple characters means mulitple bonuses e.g. Wilson for beard, Wolfgang for damage, Willow for..well..fire. Also the workshop is also included and provides some fun different characters/items to play with. Regarding dying when someone (inevitabley) dies they will become a ghost, this ghost will lower players sanity until revived into a player again using methods such as; touch stone, life giving amulet, meat effigy and after this occurs the player will have less maxium health, but this maxium health can be restored with a booster shoot (which isn't too hard, but not easy to make). Overall this is a high amount of fun espically over skype with friends but it also has a few bugs (early access).So in shortRating: 9.5/10 Would Not Starve Together Again\n",

A real hangout. Also if you install this game, you can get an expansion pack that provides sunlight and a soccer ball. If you do have a girlfriend, I recommend not playing this game because it encourages aggression on the other hand, if your girlfriend likes BDSM all for it. Also, this game dissolves relationships among your friends and promotes being an a55hole. For example, my friend who complains about CS;GO and how he is held back and blames his team mates has now become alot more aggresive and annoying in real life.

I prefer Dota 2 over LoL because:Dota 2 is a much more competetive game because you do not need to buy the heroes.

With this you can teleport a short distance in front of you, through walls, blockades and into barrels...and people.As you move through the facility, is becomes clear that stealth is vital and that you must uses your brains to solve reacurring and puzzling traps as you try to escape the clutches of the scientists.And now things get serious, as your abilites grow with (spoiler alert)  echo (a projectable ghost image of yourself), Swap (use your echo to swap places with a distant object) and Launch (shoot objects your hiding in at a violent force).And then there's Frag, the ability to explode things while your inside them, such as barrels, power supplies and...people , yes it can get a bit violent and in cold blood too, however, the scientist do talk like jerks...With impressive graphics and a rare, third-person, open roofed take on gameplay, WARP packs quite a memorable punch and will have you unable to put it down until you have all those little, slippery, impossible to catch- why-would-you-put-food-there- grubs...(one day, one day i will have all of them and purchase all the extra abilities, oh yes i will...)

      "very fun game to play with friends\n",
      "Lots of fun! Running around finding things to essentially duct-tape together weapons is a great mechanic, and executed quite well. Extend this to the creation of new vehicles, ala rollerhog; a motorcycle with a steamroller drum on the front.. oh and some flamethrowers to boot.. and you've got a recipie for a lot of zomb-hem. Zomb..saster? Zombtato?There are a few things that bug me, the worst probably being the occasional inability to pick up what you actually want despite looking directly at it. Turn your stance a bit and the item highlights.. but hey, your character wants to do a full 90 degree turn, not just 45 degrees, so again you lose the highlight and can't pick up the item.. or worse yet you pick up a cardboard box instead of an assault rifle. Some of the travel missions are a pain in the butt, sending you to all four corners of the city,. On the upside, big missions tend to have bigger rewards, but a few times I felt like I'd wasted a heap of effort. There was also a single boss mechanic which just didnt seem to work well, though I had no trouble getting through it; I still felt like it hadnt been played out the way the designers intended. Hmm.. I might watch the video on that one to see how it was meant to go down.I see a lot of potential in the co-op system, though ended up turning it off myself as the first person who jumped in was an internet-tard and decided to start swearing because I wasnt on a mic. Thankfully you can change the co-op mode at any time. I would probably play through this with a friend in co-op mode.I rate this at least three potatoes out of an unknown amount, it was very playable and had so many sweet combos and a decent player upgrade system. I rarely got stuck on missions and smaller simpler missions didnt make you work too hard, with the components for completion reasonably easy to find. Do keep in mind that some areas will be locked until further down the track, so don't try for too long to get a blueprint or collectable if it seems like you shouldn't be in the area just yet. I have seen a bunch of stuff on the net about people who couldnt play this with nvidia graphics - i'm running a radeon so I guess not much problem there for me, though might be worth researching just in case.\n",
      "\"Aw jeez... where's all this violence coming from? Is it the video games? I bet it's the video games.\"I'm just going to start off with overall ratings as I know some people don't like lengthy reviewsMajor aspects:Gameplay: 9/10 Very good for this style which has become so rare (a third person cover and shoot)Story line: 10/10 The best I have ever encountered, far better than even games such as the Telltale's “The Walking Dead” Immersion/atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere was incredible, this game is one of the rare games that you can truly lose yourself in.Graphics: 10/10 Despite the game being a few years old I have never seen a game with better graphics.Minor aspects:Realism: 8.5/10 Aside from the lack of friendly fire and the fact that you face hordes of enemies while surviving (though your health is relatively low), this game is rather realisticSmoothness (gameplay): 9/10 This game felt very nice to play and its only fault would be occasionally I would not duck for cover unless I pressed the button several times. Voice acting: 10/10 All the voices suit the characters very well and there is not a single voice actor that taints the immersion of the game.Player involvement (choices): 10/10 The choices were incredible, however I would have preferred it if there were a few more. Overall:I don't really base the score from the minor aspects so the score (from critic point of view) is:9.75/10Though, personally, I believe this is the greatest game I have ever played and would rate it:10/10General review:When I first decided to play this game I thought it was a typical trashy shooter. This was reinforced by the single player being referred to as the \"campaign\" and even more so when the game started off with a typical Gatling gun in a helicopter scene. However, a few minutes into the game I was proven wrong, this game has the greatest storyline I have ever seen, there aren't really any incredibly “tear jerking” moments as there are with games such as the walking dead, however the game still does an incredible job to connect with the player emotionally as well conveying the emotions and journey of the protagonist. Without trying to give too much away, the game also includes a variation of choices that effect the game and also lead to multiple diverse endings.The game play mainly consists of finding cover, coming up from cover and shooting enemies. Though the gameplay is repetitive the various amounts of guns, enemies terrain variations and other things, make the game continuously enjoyable. The animation of combat is very nice as well, the darting for cover and switching to different cover was a very nice animation that made the game feel extremely nice to play.The atmosphere in this game, contrasted with the outstanding graphics, creates a unique world for the player to experience. The atmosphere in this game is unlike any other shooter and truly makes you feel like a real soldier, rather than just an emotionless killing machine, this is reinforced by the two soldiers under you command that are polar opposites, I won't go into that though for it would spoil a large portion of the game. Overall I cannot recommend this game any more highly, it is easily the greatest game I have every played and the only real drawback would be the length. The game has everything that you could possibly ask and so much more. IT is incredibly unique and simply extraordinary, it is definitely worth buying and playing.\n",
      "Ok, it's probably a good thing that you looked at the reviews because the trailer does not portray the game very well. I personally have been on the fence about buying this game for a very long time, the reason being it had  confusing trailer that did not say very much at all about the game and the reviews for both good and bad seemed pretty convincing.Sow for what you actually do: this game is unlike other zombie survival games or even zombie games in general, you play in a third person perspective and you can switch between multiple characters. In this game there is a lot to think about; there are missions which you must complete (if you leave them too long then you will fail them), which can gain you trust and reputation from by completing, or loose it by leaving important tasks to decay, reputation and trust can also be effected by random events and doing stupid things like trying to run over your friends with cars, once you have enough repututation you can play as other characters or request them to join you for missions. Now for more gameplay related elements, the combat system isn't entirely great but still fun, you generally bash up zombies with melee weapons (which will eventually break) or use guns (which require ammo) combat is a big part of this game, and luckily it isn't a one bit/scratch kill, for you, in combat, zombies are pretty much just like normal people trying to kill you (execpt with zombie-like methods like biting and scratching), you have a health bar that will decrease and can be restored by taking meds such as painkillers, or by switching to another character and letting the wounded character rest. You also have a stamina bar which will deplete by sprinting, jumping and attacking, your combat bar will automatically replenish when you are not doing any of these things but grows smaller the longer it has been since you rested. Another big element of this game is vehicles, or just cars, they are a very effective method or taking out zombies and distracting them but will be damaged by ramming into things (zombies included), to my knowledge cars don't run out of fuel but they won't last long enough to find out with all the wear they go through.Now then, the zonbies, there are several types of zombies in this game, starting with basic zombies, some can be outran while others cannot because as you run so will they, there are also juggernauts, who are basically fat zombies that are difficult to kill and can throw you around which can be very damaging, espcially with other zombies around (how my first character to die was ended actually, poor Marcus :( RIP) there are also ferals, which are probably the biggest single threat, they will run up to you on their hands (which are exztremly muscular) and pummel you while you are down, you must struggle to get back up and then shoot them before they can get you down again. There are also screamers, armless zombies that amit a high pitched squeeling noise, your character will stagger when they hear it and is vulnerable to attacks during this time. Screamers are no threat by themeselves though.One last thing you should know about this gme is that you cannot load saves, when a charater dies the stay dead, when you stuff up by blowing up an awesome sports car, it stay's blown up. This make the game, in my opinion, far more enjoyable as the stakes are always much higherFor my verdict I will give it 9.5/10It has brilliant voice acting, missions, combat and or course soulfullness, the scavenging, high stakes at all times, reputation and general feel of the game are an extreme delight and though I never buy games at full price paying $20 you would definitly get your moneys worth.Feel free to comment and critic on my review.\n",
      "I played on single player and did so much better than the bots (most of the time) I thought this line from the game \"I'm thinking we can take on anything\" I played co-op with a friend and 2 bots.He went a few meters further ahead then me, after fighting off endless hordes I had no fear.One zombie got me and immoblized me.The bots followed my friend.I went down but it sill attacked, I needed help. Still no help.I died, from one zombie on full health after fighting thousands.10/10Would die for again\n",
      "This game is awesome. It is fun and very ammusing especially with the friendly fire. It is great to play with friends or random people. Probably my favourite game at the moment. I highly reccommend you get it especailly because it is 100% free.Rating:10/10Also if you want to someone to play with feel free to add me\n",
      "This game sucks, everything that people say about it is true, its basicly DayZ for poor people. But i can see this game having good future, its pretty fun to play with friends (If you can get it to work), it's addictive and it's free.\n",
      "epic game its a good survival game to play really cool but they need to work on some physics :/ apart from that its one of the best survival rpg indie shooters i have ever played totally recommend this to all my friends its so cool and now enough explaining try it out for yourself u wont regret it\n",
      "It can be fun with friends but...In genral it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that you would expect it to be in an alpha/beta stage. The pvp is fun until you realise that you are firing rubber bullets + the person taking all of those nerf gun shots is taking a whole bottle of tablets and magicaly healing themself... I would only suggest to buy this game when it is around $5 or less because it just is not worth the money for the game it is.\n",
      "The review may be like this game is ♥♥♥♥ another dino game but belive me this is a lot of fun to play with friends and solo if ya want trust 9/10 co-op FUN.\n",
      "This game is awesome and I recommend it to anyone who lives survival and PVP games and also this game is so fun to play with friends.\n",
      "This is still a work in progress while I slowly cover topics as I come by. If you need anything make a post on the forums and I'll probably be there.The upperpart of my review is of the game below that I will address the points of some of the negative reviews.Darkest Dungeon is fairly straightforward, multiple heroes with varying skills and abilities that you send off to a dark lovecraftian dungeon to fend off creatures battling to keep your health, hunger and sanity in check. In a sense it plays a little like an old Final Fantasy game, but without any pheonix downs and every monster matters.There are four seperate dungeons (and then the end game dungeon) that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and thus who you send into each area is often unique. As you select your four heroes you need to make some tough decisions. Will you send the Plague doctor? The only hero to boast both a double stun and double poison skill. The Bounty Hunter who can uppercut your enemies into different ranks? Or a mighty Man at Arms who can guard another while boosting his own defense and then next round can activate a counter attack! Rather than just a simple \"Me am warrior me am stronk!\" teams who can work together and take out the nasty healers and stress dealers, who hide in the back rank, fast and first will leave the dungeon sane while the slow teams with very little reach into the back rows will teem with madness and disease.Darkest Dungeon features a fairly linear weapon and armor system (coupled with some reasonable D&D type factors in how speed and other mechanics work) but offers a unique trinket system that can spice up combat. A disease and quirk system, diseases are obviously bad while quirks come in good and bad qualities.The final piece is the stress system, while dungeoneering your Heroes will gain stress through various means, will they crack under pressure? Or will they stand steady as a beacon of hope?In its entirety the game offers a well known system but adds several unique mechanics to really make it stand out.I would highly recommend anyone interested in this game but still unsure to watch some playthroughs on youtube.Also, check out some of the reviews with large comment chains and you'll see downvoters calling upvoters \"shills\". They're absolutely paranoid that people can like this game. It's pretty funny.For a while I thought this game was too hard, that I was doing everything right and that RNG was screwing me over.Then I got gud and realized that I had everything wrong. It is tough and RNG will kick you while you're down but many of these downvotes are blatant lies and I would like to address them here.\"You lose 10-20 hours per character that dies\" I have lost about 4 max rank characters, and a few rank 3-4 ones aswell, at time of posting this I have 88 hours gameplay. My roster is almost full of max rank characters and I beat the game. The roster has 28 slots (+12 due to end game reasons), by his/her maths I'd need about 400-800 hours to do that.\"I was 1-hit by a non crit\" utter lies. Maybe, just maybe, they had a plague doctor in the front row with double -HP trinkets... but why have some one who is essentially protected by a tissue and as weak as a kitten in that situation and then act like it's not your fault when a GIANT hits you?Many, many of the complaints are \"I don't have a good team set up and I can't hit some one at the back!\" Well that's probably their fault for bringing three units who can only hit the front two ranks and a healer.Several complaints are that the characters aren't equally powered and some outshine others, but I 100% believe the characters are extremely well balaned - it's all about using the characters correctly. For example the Plague Doctor isn't supposed to deal damage like a crusader/leper or heal HP like a Vestal, but a support class that can stun and poison (even two people at once) and stop heavy bleed/poison damage. Many - if not most - the complaints come from an update that causes stops enemies at the back from instantly moving forward when you kill a front unit. So rather than an open varied team they get upset their insanely powerful double leper set up (that guy 100% strongest solo character) can't just one hit everything.I have felt their pain but I can gaurantee that many of the complaints are biased and just frustrated that they couldn't get it right - even the forums get \"I attacked Wilbur and my characters said 'No don't do that you're upsetting the big one' and then the big one got angry WTF RNG I AM LEET PRO\" (youtube darkest dungeons wilbur fails).I am not saying that their reviews are without merit, but the devolopers have made leaps and bounds to meet in the middle.Now you can hire higher leveled heroes, bonus XP under certain conditions and some units bring resources for dungeons and even a new class that adds some risk V reward.And if all else fails, ask for help on the forums. I sure have, the people there are (mostly) friendly and are willing to help.I have yet to find a bug or skill working improperly.If you find flaw within my review (and my review of negative reviews) please feel free to criticize or offer advice.\n",
      "Took me a full 45 min round to discover how to mute people in this game when some 12 year old kid started singing in russian while his parents were litterally screaming at each other in the background.

Sincerely, I never saw other games doing what arms series accomplished.Now the bad thing is that you really have to be patient.vafterall it's an tactical fps.The game modes, some of them are cf funny, some are full with very skilled players.Conclusion.

      "This game's good. It's like shitcraft (Minecraft) but with more weapons, armour, bosses and it's 2D. It's really fun in multiplayer, but it's hard to do because of connection things.I recommend doing it solo first, then play with your friend who is also as experienced as you for maximum enjoyment.\n",
      "Convinced me to put over $100 dollars in my steam account and basically waste it on dress upsThere's also some fighting 10/10Would recommend to friends and family\n",
      "General features (can be viewed as pros):-Race customization is fairly detailed-Ship designer is good, even better because you can use pre-existing models and modify them to your own tastes-Certain resources are linked to certain celestial bodies eg antimatter surround black holes, elerium in nebulae, etc. So a savvy player, upon seeing a nebula knows to explore it fully incase there is elerium and that a black hole is likely to have some antimatter surrounding it. -powerful resources like antimatter are more limited, but using them is non-destructive so there wont be buyers remorse, ie you'll get the resource back if you destroy the building/ship that uses it. This also allows you to use resources early in buildings tech, and then recycle it when a better option arrives, meaning that a player who can manage his resources well will do better than one who just holds onto resources until a \"top tier\" usage for them is unlocked.-massive maps are possible, so with the right settings it doesnt feel like a \"small\" galaxy or that you're running out of space (until late game)-starbases used intelligently can give an edge at all points in the game, especially economic starbases. eg rather than waste a building slot on your planet to raise approval, just get the approval upgrade on the starbase linked to the planet.-able to finely control research/economy output/dedication on planets individually, but also with the \"govern\" tab you can do this en mass, saving time. Same applys for upgrading ships, etc.-every planet has an event, which some may find annoying, but I think is good, allows you do add a slight layer of uniqueness to each planet as well as develop your ideology.-its actually more beneficial long terms to dabble in all ideologies to some extent, as long as your primary ideology has most points you wont have an ideological shift. This means you dont have to do the unrealistic option (as in some games with ideologies/religions) and devote 100% to an ideology. This also means, if desired, you can play on the basis of the moral choices involved for events/planets and still do OK in terms of ideological benefit (as opposed to number crunching the statistical/numerical benefits for each choice planet, etc)Cons- diplomacy at first seems well developed, but that's only for early game. Late game diplomacy is at best, shallow, at worst, buggy. \"Benevolent\" ideologies seem to hate pragmatic ideologies as much as \"malevolent\" ideologies, which is silly and means that as a pragmatist, you need to kill anyone else who isn't a pragmatist and can only really form alliances with other pragmatists. This makes a diplomacy victory in a large game close to impossible without a decent military (because you need to kill anyone who refuses to ally with you), which means its always going to be predominantly a conquest based game.--continuing on for diplomacy: enemies will gladly colonise planets within starsystems you have partially colonized and there's no warning to tell them to ♥♥♥♥ off (as in games like CIV 5), and the same for resources. Early game is basically en-mass resource grab if you dont want to be screwed over mid/late game.-pirates/barbarians in 4X games are normally some kind of great equalizer early game to prevent a military/expansion snowball (eg sins of a solar empire, civ, etc), but in this game they're just annoying and dont do much besides kill the occasional scout. also, AI dont appear to be bothered by pirates, so its just a player handicap.-once you start going balls to the walls crazy large military, the game will start glitching out your \"military power\" parameter, which means for the purposes of diplomacy, one turn later everyone will think you're the weakest, declare war/♥♥♥♥ with you even though you could wipe them out. this also contributes to the impossiblity of a diplomacy victory (without killing loads of people) -terraforming in the incorrect order can cost you between 1-3 tiles per planet, which is a fair amount. eg if you use a higher grade terraformer on a \"easy\" tile, you wont be able to terraform the \"harder\" tiles, as late game you can terraform as many \"easy\" tiles as you like, meaning its better long term to hold off on terraforming until you've researched it fully as it isnt always clear which tiles are \"easy\" or \"hard\".-money is weak, it can take anywhere between 5-15 turns to be able to afford to rush construction (pretty much the only use of money, besides upgrading your military ships) whereas focusing on manufacturing allows you to build anything in 1-3 turns. Basically as long as you break even with your economy, you can just focus on manufacturing and research. Its actually usually better to just decommission old ships and build news ones rather than upgrade them (which will make you bankrupt quick if you have a large army)---In other words with the diplomacy + economy balancing, there is no viable economy based strategy or peaceful based strategy. No matter what, you will always need the strongest military regardless of your intended method of victory (unlike some other 4X games, where you could have an adequate military and with good diplomacy/economy still obtain most victory types you desire). And basically to get the strongest military you need to focus on research and manufacturing.- united galaxies is but a shallow addition to the game, furthermore, if someone ever defies (which is almost always), they are permanently booted, which can lead to the ridiculous situation of having a united galaxy meeting of 2 members, while the other 6-10 races are \"defiant\" (yet have not formed another united galaxies).meh features:-culture. you must have decent culture to stop other races culture from \"flipping\" your planets, it also creates territorial space and (I think) it allows your ships to fly further into enemy space. problem is that if your culture is too strong it flips the planets of other races, including that of your allies. this makes your allies weaker and it entirely possible for them to be wiped off the map (further adding to the difficulty of a diplomacy victory). It also may land you a bunch of crap planets that you dont want to deal with. Fortunately you can give the ♥♥♥♥ planets to the minor races (who are immune to culture flipping)note: most of these issues dont apply to multiplayer games, this is predominantly a critique of single player. although culture flipping feature will suck when playing co-op with friends.Do I regret buying the game at full price? a bitam I enjoying the game? yesshould you buy this game full price? only if you plan to win/enjoy by conquest every time or if you only care about multiplayershould you buy this game on discount? yes, if it were at 25% discount it would be a good priceit should be noted that stardock have a good trackrecord for improving/patching their games post release, so I anticipate that some of these issues I have raised will be gone in the future.\n",

O.o* also very likely to run into the same team you are playing are in singleplayer and most of the time it'll hate you *of course hate it's self?* game is weird, funny, a little buggy (of course still fairly new game), but all up fun even in single player unlike other 4x stratergy games which get boring in single player quickly. recommend buying it but like all game not perfect but still get it if u like 4x stratergies, and fantasy (but can be a bit anoying when a quest tells u to declare war on an ally T_T luckly ai in this can be forgiving)\n",

This keeps the interest going for much longer then you would expect, and with it's multiplayer feature it is realy fun and enjoyable to pla with friends. This game get's a 15 out of 10! and i strongly recomend this game to anyone at all that want's a good experience that will stay with them for a very long time!

Don't be fooled by the bundles, its a balanced game, only differentiating people by skill and team-play. Good to play with friends, as you can coordinate with them. It is certainly a new type of FPS and im already getting addicted to it. Andrenaline pumped action? check. Fast Gameplay? check. Badass bots to ride? check. And to top it off, ITS FREE! Definitely a must see for those looking for a good game.\n",
      "This is good. very good. but sometimes when missions require some teammates due to the terryfyingly hard to kill bosses, its also fiendishly hard to find people to team up with. other than that, its a great game if you have a constant group of friends who plays together with you.\n",
      "it is a good game to play with friends where funny will happen\n",
      "I strongly recommend this game if you are into the diablo sty fighting game i love the castle build its fantastic the way you can collect loot from your friends castle is amazing. But i wish they just put in more content like when your friend is attacking your castle you can attack them. This game had so much potential but i hope in the future updates they will add more content in the game itself and possibly bring multiplayer.\n",
      "Payday 2 has everything you would want in a bank heist. The ability to customize your own mask and weapons and mainly share the same experience with your friends. I would highly recommend this game to people who want a thrill and a laugh with friends. Probably one of my favourite games.\n",
      "I personally do not recommend this game, i do have many friends but none have this game, therefore it is quite boring and the graphics are not great, however i do reccommend guns of icarus online as it is a fantastic online game that never gets boring and you dont need friends to have the game to have fun as there is a whole bunch of people, i greatly recommend you dont get this game and just go straight for the online one.\n",

      "I see alot of people raving on in the reviews section about SUPERHOT coming exlusivly for oculus rift. This is not the case. The devs have stated that it will come to ALL VR headsets with hand tracking controllers eventually, and this will not effect regular SUPERHOT. Calm the ♥♥♥♥ down. Reviewing the game poorly because of the devs descision regarding the VR experience and not on the gameplay itself is completely ridiculous. This review will be based off of the gameplay and my personal experience with SUPERHOT and not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery that is the rest of these reviews. SUPERHOT is one of the most innnovative first person shooters i have ever experienced in my gaming life. It provides A new challenge to the average Gamer to think differently about how they approach a battle using a rarely used mechanic, time. The story in the main part of the game is amazing, it makes you feel as though the game is really comeing alive and there is something sinister about what your doing and why your killing these red guys. With the endless and challenge modes the player is able to extend their experience with SUPERHOT and challenge thier friends in time trail like challenges and test their SUPERHOT skills in a variety of challenges. With soon to come FREE DLC, i can see myself spending alot more time in the world of SUPERHOT.In conclusion, great game, would definetly reccomend it to my mates, 25 bucks may seem a bit expensive but for me it was worth it. Hope to see this game grow.\n",

      "A thoughtful meditation on isolation and the complexity of real world relationships. I've never played a hiking sim with such a deep and rich plot before.The simplicity of gameplay is deceptive - the true value of this game lies in the varied experiences of players in how they tackle the game and the conversations it throws at you with Delilah, the lookout coordinator in Thorofare tower and ostensibly your only contact in the world. Finish it, talk about it with your friends, let it sink in and think a bit, then come back and play it again in a few months.V. rewarding.\n",

      "http://youtu.be/EobPYzFICy4I still remember getting my copy of the original Battle Chess as a young boy and being fascinated by finding out what all the different animations were ... being amazed by the humour behind it (not knowing at the time how much of it was basically Monty Python-esque) and playing against my friends for hours ... Some of the combat animations still make me giggle today when I think of them .... ahh childhood memories ... I bought this early access over the weekend with hesitant optimism ... I spent a while playing around with it and the game definitely has promise ... some of the transitions bug out a little bit ... and some of the cuts are a bit jarring ... but the foundations are there for a faithful sequel to the original ... the humour is there (even if some of it feels a little bit forced) ... and there are now multiple combat animations for each 'combination' of pieces! ... What I would love to see is them making it a bit more adult (more blood! more brutal combat animations) even if that is an option you have to select ... and also additional character sets (medieval is already there ... but what about fantasy, futuristic, etc ... how awesome would that be!) ...I can't comment on the AI yet as I played a game on easiest just to have a look around at how the whole thing fitted together ... but all chess games live or die by their AI so I hope that in this day and age we have a great AI ...All in all I think they are headed in the right direction ... and hopefully they will be able to smoothen out the bumps and make this a game that I will be playing in years to come ...\n",

      "Time to start... What do I say?This is probably one of the best games ever made. It provides endless hours of gameplay that never ceases to change, when I first started off playing this I was a little slow at progressing, now ask anyone I play with and they say that I'm still pretty slow ;)There is always people playing and as there is in any game, the hardcore group of players dedicated to winning.With 2 huge expansions to the game it just adds to the diversity that this game already had. Adding more and more fun and challenge each way.I would, have and will again reccomend this game to all my friends and to ANYONE I MEET!It also provides a thrilling singleplayer that is preety much Multiplayer but with rationally thinking peopleI give this game a 9.5/10Only because it can be a little stressful on less powerful machines.But I've seen it play relativley well on a Lenovo iX30 Which has an i3 Intel so Thats preety good in itself\n",
      "The game is great-don't get me wrong but the amount of crap that goes on really out balances the fun.-HackersThe game is plagued with hackers, I even managed to make friends with one and they told me about all the crazy stuff they can do like x-ray vision, all blueprints, a forcefield where if someone enters the vicinity it kills them, speedhacks, rangefinders, aimbots and so much more.-Admins.  So, you play on a server for a while and then it goes three waysa) Map resetb) Admin uses invisibility and spawns C4 and stuffs up your base.c) A hacker joins the server and owns everyone whilst the admin is busy with a finger up their ♥♥♥ and VAC is doing its work which takes a while.So really, when you buy Rust, there's a hidden server fee unless you want to get owned and owned again by any of this.  -GlitchesThere are these cracker ♥♥♥ rock bases where people can build structures inside of rocks and unless you get really lucky or have a hacker friend to x-ray the heck out of the map to find these bases or the admin does something, you really have no chance to win against theses guys because the have a super safe house.-DevelopmentSo Facepunch is working on a reboot which makes the game much easy to update and what not.  This is all fun and dandy except this means the rock bases and other glitches I don't even know about go unpatched for ages until this reboot is done.\n",

      "Im going to make this review simple, ark is a amazing game. It is full of amazing things to do and explore, with the devs constantly updating the game it obviously isn't a money grabber. It is a good game to play with your friends and on servers with other people. You meet new people and make new friends which isn't very common these days on most other games.Here are my pro's and con's.Pro's:-This game hasn't been abandoned and is constantly recieving updates on bug fixes and tweaks.-It has a huge play time, I have owned the game for quite a while but only been able to play it for the last 2 weeks, since then I have almost got 100 hours on it, you certainly don't get bored of it.-Thanks to the devs and the amazing community ark has lots of mods to offer, so if you do end up getting bored you can just download a amazing map to a awesome weapon add-on mod.Con's:-Ark is a heavy game, if you havent got a beefy ♥♥♥ computer (at least GTX 760) you are probably not going to be able to run ark at a stable frame rate. I had this issue on my old PC and I was only able to run the game at super low graphics and recieve maybe 15 frames if lucky. So don't be tempted to buy the game if your computer isn't going to be able to handle it.Conclusion:Other than having issues running the game on a low end computer this game is amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a game to soak up their time, go exploring, hunting, listen to top notch banter and many more, if so THIS IS YOUR GAME.\n",

      "Great game to play with your friends!\n",
      "First off, this is a good mod, it shows lots and lots of untapped potential yet it is so lacking in so many ways, which I will list here.1.) Single player onlyWhile I was playing this I somewhat thought of call of duty zombies, and how well they can make a hoarde mode in their games, and how well multiplayer is used in it, and how you  can progress (which will be covered later) through the maps instead of you and your friends huddled in a corner. The game seriously needs this, it can potentially call for alot of funny moments and alot of fun times too. More often than not, in antlion survival I'm always having my ♥♥♥ eaten off and squished against a corner, and I'll have no cover fire. until I just eventually die. Another way this can be used could be like a tower defense  gamemode, where you and a couple of pals or randoms fight whatever comes your way while defending objectives, or have a somewhat progression throughtout the map, and make them beatable and have somewhat of a storry to keep us sane while we wait for HL32.) balancing/leveling systemIf you've played longer than 10 minutes, you know that eventually you will get infinite ammo, and have a shotgun spam fest. thats right, you can just double barrel fire the shotgun and jump around the map forever without dying or even being harmed. Basically every weapon but shotguns,rpgs,grenades and other explosives are useless.Leveling up gives you perks (most noted infinite aux and ammo) which are mostly just health and armor, and will give you extra health and armor upon leveling up. that presents another problem, you cannot die. when your b-hopping around shooting the shotgun, you get lots of xp, which raises your health, and your enemies do not level up along with you, just their numbers (which at times, including the antlion survival modes, can be extremel annoying) and it seems that the only way  you can die is just going afk and going on a date, shopping for groceries, walking your dog, watching 2001 a space odyssey, reading the whole harry potter series, and replacing all the walls in your house, while you get damaged by enemies.3.)Mapsthese are just the maps from HLDM, seriously, this game was made to be a hoarde mode right?? be creative will you????rating of the game at the current moment: 4/10 needs many improvements, unfinished, too easy\n",
      "Full review:- UpdateThe latest Crimefest content has forced me to now give a negative rating. This game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins, which can only be purchased with real money, provide stat boosts, as if DLCs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enough.Everything else is copied from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, including the rarity, \"safes\", keys, and the 'Inspect Weapon' animation.Shame on you Overkill.Will NOT recommend.- StorylineThere is not much plot to PAYDAY 2, which is staged in Washington, DC and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics, rob a bank, rob a big bank, rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of \"Four Men, All Votes\" instead of \"One Man, One Vote\". Community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the break-out of a fellow heister who was sabotaged. However, some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed.- GameplayThe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements, loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played, similar to that of Left 4 Dead 2. Different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players -- although some do get annoying at times and when you've played long enough, you'll become experienced enough to handle the same old variations.Some of the heists are also quite short-lived, as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists, making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring. A new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes. Newer heists such as The Big Bank Heist and Hoxton Breakout provide a quicker pace and a longer fight between the law enforcers and you -- but similarly it does not provide much variations. As such, the game has a balance of good and dull heists -- I had expected better seeing the awards though.There are four difficulties ranging from Normal to Death Wish, where Overkill would be the commonest difficulty when you're experienced and Death Wish would provide a truly engaging experience, unless you are stealthing and have not been caught. However, if you are new to the game, don't be eager to start in these high difficulties (although Normal difficulty is truly boring even for a low level).You can heist in Singleplayer mode, which limits you to yourself and 2 team AI bots, or you can play Multiplayer with 3 other players. The Singleplayer mode, which can be played offline, is annoying as Overkill reduced the number of bots from 3 to 2. Although the bots are tank on their own and can regenerate health and ammo, the bots lack skills and ability to help transport loot, making the player \"all on their own\" to carry out the goals. Bots can also be interrupted by law enforcers and makes it extremely annoying when they stop reviving you to fight back even when you're going to custody in a second or the revival would complete in a second. Bots are also essentially useless in stealth missions and all they do is to prepare in case the heist gets loud. In Multiplayer, things are more interesting and PAYDAY 2 mainly revolves around multiplayer as different user interactions definitely makes the heist experience a more unique one.Bugs are also common (to an extent) in PAYDAY 2. While some are fixed in the following few patches, others appear to be unresolved from day one till now.- GraphicsPlaying on 1920 x 1080 resolution, there has not been any major, gameplay-affecting pixelation yet and the lighting effects are not over-emphasised (which can cause the light bulbs to be brighter than the sun). The law enforcers' faces, especially the snipers, do look contorted though and probably can be improved. Some jagged edges are visible though unlikely to be noticed in normal gameplay. Graphic designs are however, in general, not neglected. Walls are vandalised with graffiti instead of being left blank, food menus in the cafe stores are actually filled up and paintings can be destroyed.That being said, the textures and details are often extremely blurred, such as the bank branding on ATM doors and food products. Even if you argue that the grafitti blurred out due to age, it's too blurred for any monitor with a resolution greater than 720p (or somewhere there). Although this game is a few years old, with the constant updates and huge game file size, you would think it has better graphics than the current, outdated one.- Character Feature(s)PAYDAY 2 follows system similar to that of RPG where there are 5 skill trees and several perk builds for you to choose from. You gain skill points upon leveling up and perk points upon receiving XP. Although more dynamic compared to PAYDAY 1 as every player will now have (slightly) different builds and thus different abilities (compared to a high level player which simply has everything), the grinding can get tedious once you have reached level 70+ or 80+. This has been more or less rectified with the XP changes and it has been much easier to level up since then.PAYDAY 2 also allows more customisation compared to PAYDAY 1, where you can customise the mask colour, pattern and texture instead of simply choosing the masks. This allows more than a few million combinations for masks to choose from (although some are downright unappealing). Masks are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay, other than showing your artistic sense.Weapons can also be customised using the limited range of weapon modifications, which can be extended via DLC to gain access to better or more flexible mods. Some mods are achievement-locked and require you to grind for them.- MusicThe soundtracks suits the gameplay rather well, tensing up when law enforcement assault starts and slowing down when it ends, giving an additional brief respite. Depending on the heist the soundtrack was based on, it can be classical music, a retro-styled music or even just \"exciting\" music that you can follow to. The soundtrack DLC is needed if you want the mp3 or FLAC files, which further allows you to customise your in-game soundtracks without the need to purchase other heist DLCs for the soundtrack. - PricingRefer to update.- VerdictAt its age, I would have expected more than DLC-locked content which are pumped out more often than free content (which wouldn't have mattered as much if the DLCs are more reasonably priced). Despite the potential in the game, I am upset that the game has evolved into one that is simply money-making without actual new content.We are not robbing banks, guys. We are the ones getting robbed here.\n",
      "Short Review:Virtual Hat Simulator. With Cash.Full Review:- StorylineThe plot is simple. There is a war going on between the Builders League United (BLU) and Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED), both subsidiaries of TF Industries. However, due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution, mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war. You join one of the two teams (not permanently) and play as one of the nine mercenaries (hereby named 'classes') which each has its own unique features in a war to Attack/Defend (e.g. Payload, Attack/Defend Control Points) or to gain control (e.g. King of the Hill, 5CP, Special Delivery)- Gameplay/ClassesThe nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many (or the lack thereof) of one class leads to an imbalanced team, causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of co-operating to push towards their objective. The nine classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper Medic and Spy all have their own distinct features, ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper. The weapons are more or less well-balanced, in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon, although it does suit different fighting styles.With new maps (almost, or at least somewhat) consistently introduced, you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team, players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help, or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you don't stand a chance (unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping). You might also join a \"friendly\" server where you see players just taunting and \"Conga-ing\" or walking around, and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.- WeaponsMost weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play, so as to \"encourage playing\" until the item drop cap for that week is reached. Strange and Festive variants can be obtained by using keys (purchased with Steam Wallet) to unlock normal, rare and seasonal crates. These are however, purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway (besides distracting you). Using the weapons you get, you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon, such as the Mauler and Sharp Dresser. Some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general, the weapons are considered sidegrades -- except for several Medic melee weapons, all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given.- Cosmetics & Online InteractionTeam Fortress is well-known as hat simulator. Using the weapon drops you get, you can craft them into Refined Metals and eventually recombine them to get a common (named as 'Unique' in the wiki, and 'Normal' in-game) quality hat (TF2 Premium DLC is required, obtained upon any in-game store purchase). Rarely, you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops. This purely decorates your character but does \"most\" of the gameplay here. Saw that cool-looking unusual guy? Aim him. Saw that gibus (an achievement hat) guy? Aim him. See that guy with ten thousand kills on his strange weapon? Aim him. That dumbass guy who just started playing? Aim him. (There's some toxicity in every game, so expect that.)The cosmetics also run all of the trading in TF2 and it is what allows you to actually earn (or lose) money (in terms of keys) and/or Steam Wallet (by selling the keys on the market). If you are lucky during an unbox, you can also get an Unusual-quality cosmetic or taunt, basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect, and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects (market and player dependent).You can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want. Trading is based on own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this cannot exactly be reviewed. Online interactions are not rated.- VerdictIt's a fine game for playing, similar to those less traditional FPS that you play, i.e. not the Counter-Strike types. Other than tryhards who remain tryhards and you can never kill them, or beggars or trolls which you can mute or change a server, this game offers many playstyles which will definitely suit you, at least one way or another.\n",
      "Short Review:Improved since Orion Horde, but largely remains to be seen. There's still plenty of room for improvement.Full Review:- GameplayThe game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The \"Capturing Base\" message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.- Changes in GameplayThe last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing \"how much their game has improved\". Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.- Graphics/Visual AppealDespite the \"massive overhaul\" from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to \"focus\" on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be \"simple\" or complex enough to be \"complex\". It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?- Bugs (?)There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.- VerdictBy now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.\n",
      "This is an Early Access review.Short Review:Guardians of Orion significantly improved on what they did with Orion Prelude, though I do wish that they actually 'finish up' Orion Prelude first. (I might change the review of Prelude soon.) The game is playable despite some buggy features and is, in my opinion, not yet worth the full price. However, it does look very promising and has the potential to be one of the best first-person-shooter-♥♥♥-third-person-shooter game ever released.Full Review:- First-Time Set-upYou need to create an account separate from Steam. There appears to be no confirmation e-mail sent and the game will automatically logs you in. There is no log-out button either, and I am rather confused about the Orion account. This does not affect gameplay but more likely it has to do with backup of your game data on their servers, as well as keeping track of account balance/funds (to be implemented).- CompatibilityThe game appears to have full controller support. Most help text will reference controller buttons instead of keyboard buttons even if you have no controller.- StorylineSimilar to Orion Prelude, you have to survive waves of dinosaurs and protect a (few) harvestor(s) in their survival mode. A PVP mode among several others are planned but not yet released.- UniquenessThe most interesting aspect of the game is being able to toggle between first-person and third-person. The experience is rather difficult to describe and appears to be plain on paper, but incorporating the mechanics is indeed impressive. When in first-person mode, you do what most first-person shooters do. You use your mouse to aim at dinosaurs (both land and sky), right-click to zoom-in closer to the reticle (the scope is currently non-functional) and left-click to shoot (duhh). There is a sprint button but no jump button. Instead, you have a 'dodge roll' bound to your spacebar which you can use to evade specific dinosaur attacks (with cooldown, no continuously rolling across the floor and becoming invincible). In third-person mode, aiming becomes more simple as you gain a 360 degree view around you so there is no sneak dinosaur attacks from your back in first-person view. I am not sure if there is any way to aim the angle of weapon, as I find difficulty trying to kill dinosaurs in the sky. Right-clicking increases your field-of-vision of the map, while sprinting decreases it.- GameplayThe game features both online mode and offline mode. In online mode, you will first enter a lobby where you have to walk to a station before you can open the server browser and join or create a game. In offline mode, there appears to be support for multiple players.There are currently 7 classes in the game, each with their unique primary and secondary weapon (usually a pistol). The special tertiary weapon appears to be the same for all classes, which is a healing gun used to repair the harvester, your health and your armour (albeit rather slowly). You get to change your class in-between waves. Each class also feature 3 different skill groups that you get to spend your skill points in, to improve your character weapons, functionality or to unlock new special weapons.About 6 maps are currently present, with different texture and settings but mostly similar terrain. The maps feature destructive props such as the rocks and trees that can be destroyed by the player and/or dinosaurs.In survival mode, you are able to occasionally collect crafting materials and/or from killed dinosaurs, as well as from 'bonus chest' that are spawned after killing the boss within the time limit. Crafting materials can be used to upgrade your existing gear and augment weapons, although I have yet to find out how. The equipment will be shared among all classes and will affect a number of statistics, some of which are self-explanatory while others are unexplaned. You get to respawn after dying or getting eaten. If less severe, you fall into an incapacitated state where you can still shoot with your pistol and get revived by a friendly teammate.There is currently a lack of vehicles compared to Orion Prelude. Currently, AI teammates also appear to be absent.- Graphics/Visual AppealIn first-person mode, the textures do look great compared to many of the other AAA games, especially given its smaller file size. However, it worsened in third-person mode where the grass and trees look rather dull and flattened. In first person-mode, your screen will act as the visor and feature cracks when your armour gets destroyed and your health becomes low. Weather effects are likely to be added.- BugsBugs are likely to be expected in an early access game. One of the more noticeable ones that affected me was in first-person mode, where the rifle does not always fire at where the reticle is, even when standing still. I am using the Sharpshooter class with a sniper rifle, and zooming in does not help. I believe this is not intended and will likely be fixed.- Pricing & VerdictAt its infant stage, the game does look promising. You get a 'Founder' status for buyung the game early, and it appears that future guardians will need to unlock classes with in-game currency. I do like the game, but given its current state of development and basic gameplay, I would not really recommend buying at its full price. However, be sure to get it during deep discounts.\n",
      "Short Review:The game has literally nothing to do with the music. Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.Full Review:- GameplayThe game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims “Discover gameplay with custom music” . There's nothing to customise at all.- ControlsThe controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way. - VerdictI am glad I got it for free. It was a waste of time to even install it.\n",
      "Short Review:The game is dead. Avoid it at all cost.Full Review:- GameplayThe game is about monkeys fighting other monkeys and trying to maintain their own power core.Concept looks similar to other games like Awesomenauts, but since this game only has PvP (no bots or offline mode) and ALL servers in ALL regions are empty, this game is essentially non-playable.As a result, I can't really rate the gameplay at all. Other than a negative rating for the absence of offline mode.- VerdictRun it for the trading cards. Unless you happen to have some friends and you can withstand the brighter-than-the-sun glow from the damned torch.\n",
      "This game is extremely entertaining, literally hundreds and hundreds of hours without getting bored. Has a slight learning curve but is extremely easy to get the basics of. Incredibly fun with friends  as well. Been addicted for ages to this game. Finished a nation playthrough? Go for many of the hundreds of achievements that are actually achievements, play as any of the hundreds of nations there are, go for achievements or world conquest. PS: Watch out for Baguette and Kebab though :)Seriously though this game is insane, I also recommend getting the soundtracks as they are pretty awesome as well!\n",
      "If being able to laugh at your friend having a smaller ♥♥♥♥ than you doesn’t sell this game, I don’t know what will.\n",
      "very fun game and the best part is that you get to play online with your friends! :Dif you dont have this game yet i feel sorry for you\n",
      "Great game, fun to play with friends. But at its current state I can't recommend it. There is just not enough people playing and not enough things to do. Sure there is always base building, but once you have actually finished your base, you have completed the game. recently had vehicles released but have not had the opportunity to try them out. If the game once again picks up in players I will consider playing it again. But at the moment, I would look around for a different game. Unless of course you have a big group of friends to play with.\n",
      "Without a doubt this is a good game, if you are interested in game development. I see a lot of reviews saying that this game really moved me, or it will change your life. But for me it didn't, not to say that this game isn't emotional or moving would be wrong. On one side it's a story of someone who loves making games that are different in every way, and then his friend made him lose his interest somehow or something along those line. On the oother side it a story of a person who deeply cares about his friend and wants to help him somehow but things don't go as planned. I don't see this as a sad game, I see it as an old friend try to get in contact with another friend to rebuild their friendship. Anyway make of it what you will, im just another guy on steam.\n",
      "The Gameplay is good and the graphics have an authentic feel that makes you feel at home after playing for a while, Good class system and battle controls, only problems are weapons, While I feel that buying the usage of weapons with in game money is annoying and slow, it adds a sense of accomplishment when you raise yourself up to a level by beating enemies higher then you, for me it made me feel a deep sense of comaraderie when I played with my small group of friends, each on of this in the same room, shouting at each other for not healing them or not supporting eachother, then when we won we would head to the bannered mare and play some music for other players before logging off.\n",
      "Starbound is a game where you roam endlessly until you get bored, which, by the way, may take quite a whileThis game is a good game getting better and better through each updateThe game designers and the public modders are always adding new content to keep you and you friends occupied for hours.10/10\n",

You'll eventually work through them but there is no need ro rush it. Offers Extra character classes and levels. Completion offers even more content.-Loot is luck-based, you will be farming equipment each tier for a while.Note that this game is quite dated and with the sequel coming soon, the player count is lacking.\n",
      "A very fun and addicting game!This game takes the basics of survival based games, and puts you into a never sleeping world full of bandits and abandoned towns ripe for looting. This game, for anyone who is craving a good survival game, is a perfect cure for your crave.This game is constantly onlineBeing constantly online means tons more suspense and a reason to keep coming back to the game. Also, most servers I have played on are sleeping servers, which means that when you log out you just sleep on the floor so other players can kill you and take your stuff. All while your offline! This may put some people off the game but to me, I love it even more as it makes me want to build a basic shelter as fast as I can before I log off. This makes me feel way more involed in the world then I actually am. Which is what a game should always try to make me do, and Rust has done it perfectly here.Building a house is rewardingBuilding a good and safe home in Rust is hard! Especially when you want to build a big tower (Good luck!) With a lot of bandits roaming the world of Rust, you first have to ask yourself, is my home practicle? Will it keep me safe? Will people easily be able to break in? Will I survive long enough to finish it? You must always ask yourself this before building a house as they are all questions that, if answerd with yes, will keep you alive. But once you finish that fantastic house. It feels rewarding. Unlike Minecraft where you only need to get some blocks and you have a house, Rust is very unforgiving when it comes to houses. You'll need A LOT of recources to make a safe house.ConstantlyOnlineI've already talked quite a lot about how I love this game being online so I'll make this brief. With the world always being online, logging on can be scary. For instance, you could have been raided and killed while you were away, losing days work and making you start all the way from the begining. You must know who to trust. If anyone comes around your house, asking for food two things could be happening: One, he genuinly is new to the server and does need food or, two he has a barrel gun ready to shoot you. (Yes, I'm talking from experience, haha.) It's moments like these you can't get in many other games, which makes things like this very fun and scary.In AlphaFor a Alpha game, it's pretty complete. Yes, there are a few bugs here and there but, as far I have seen nothing gamebreaking.This game, from the outside, can easily be compared to games like 7 Days to Die and Minecraft but it's way more then that. Do you feel like building a giant tower and  snipe all who come to close? Go ahead. Do you just want to run around, causing trouble? Have fun. Do you want to make a big group with your friends and raid the biggest building in your area? Thats cool. This game has limitless possibilities! The price of 20 bucks for an unfinished game may make some people look away, but dont! Because if you do, you'll be missing out on one of the best Steam games you'll ever have in your library.\n",

      "\"5 STARS! A+! 4 MORE STARS!\" is wah i wish i could say for this game. now dont get me wrong, this game is phenomenal, but there are issues.firstly the good:-the graphics:for an indie game, this game looks awesome! the enemies are varied and unique (most of the time), the particle effects are spot on, and the backdrops are beatiful. i'd put them in a frame if i had a printer.-the music: it is again, very good. a very ambient, but somewhat blood-pumping sci-fi alien (almost metroid like) soundtrack. pretty much my favourite bits would be the guitar riffs in level 1 :)-the Gameplay:solid movement and hit detection. i never over estimate a jump. little to no glitches. and a fool proof way to stop people from farming the same mobs endlessly (that difficulty meter that fills as you spend more time in a stage. GENIUS.)and did i mention mulltiplayer. because that is important. this game is worlds bette rwith multiplayer as you and your frined muck about and get killed. alot.now the bad...-graphics arent everything and in a game where the very asthectic is a simple but appealing 32 bit pixel asthetic, its hard to complain. but in later levels of the game (or just later difficulties)i would continually lose myself in the swarm of mobs and lose a chunk of my health because i couldnt see my tiny-as-an-atom charecter amongst all of these behemoths who were similarly colured, and end up accidentally jumping off a platform.-the difficulty meter/timer is, as i said earlier: genius. but it fills a little too quickly. during the early hours of the game i found myself getting crushed by mobs as they were continually getting stronger at an alarming rate, while i  was struggling to pick them off. if i may present a solution to this problem: allow the player to pick how quickly they want the difficulty meter to filleasy mode might be 8 mins to get from very easy > easy, normal can be the standard time, and hard can be 2-3 minutes between difficulties.------so despite the minor flaws with the game (and me sounding a little pretentious during this review), this game is definiteley worth your time for those who have never tried a rogue-lite game before. the multiplaayer is a great way for you to learn with a friend, and once your done learning, you'll see theres more depth, more challenge, than what you were already presented with (and you already had alot to begin with!)4/5 stars :)\n",
      "MXGP, the official motocross videogame. This is a good simulation of the real motocross event and how the bike handles. You can play as the official riders and race on the real world motocross tracks. Also, you get bikes like KTM, Suzuki, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Tm (I don't remember the last manufacturer). In Career mode, you start as a wildcard rider and if you are good enough, you'll move up to the MX1 class. The riding physics are good, and it is somewhat newbie-friendly. It will take a while to get used to the handling of the bike, and the AI (on easy they can be a challenge if you are new to the game).One drawback is you can't turn off the controller vibration. This is pretty annoying, especially for someone who doesn't like to play with vibration (like me). The multiplayer? There's almost no one playing there, but it doesn't bother me.If you are planning to get this game, I suggest that you get a controller first. You'll have a hard time playing using the keyboard. If you like racing or sports games, I would recommend this game. It's a pretty fun game overall.\n",
      "Despite being 4-year-old game, I still think that this game is worth playing. This game doesn't actually require much skill in FPS, so it's a relatively simple game for starters (except higher difficulties). The gameplay is fascinating, with the addition of melee weapons. In addition, go ahead and use mods to enhance your gameplay experience (if you think the game is not cool enough). Visit the Steam Workshop or L4DMaps.com to download and install your favourite mods made by the community. If you are a new player, I suggest playing Single Player before heading into Multiplayer. Get used to the weapons and campaigns first. Once you have acquired those skills, then head into multiplayer. Make some friends, and enjoy! Be careful though, there are malacious players out there (teamkilling and ruining the game on purpose), so try to avoid playing with those players. Anyway, I would recommend playing this game if you are a fan of zombie-killing or First-person shooter games!\n",
      "I have been recommended to pick this game up by someone and man, is it a fun ride!Like silly things? Love platformer games? Then Battleblock Theater is for you! The main features of this game is to solve puzzles, collect in-game currency (Gems and Yarns) and release prisoners as well as purchasing weaponry for your character. You will start with a number of default player settings, but as you progress, you will have a LOT of things to pick from to enhance your experience while playing. (The narration style even made me laugh.)That's not all, you can also bring friends (or family) along to play, either from your own computer or on the Internet to co-operate OR battle against each other (Co-Op needs 2 players and competitive matches need 4). Artistically talented or want something else other than the faces the game already provided? Then custom heads are your thing! All you need is a digital art program of choice (Don't use MS Paint though, it doesn't have transparency feature), empty, transparent 128x128 image template and for you to draw a head from scratch or take one from other sources, then save and put it in your game data. (On Windows: Computer > [YOUR USERNAME](C)/: > Program Files (if you have a 64-bit system, STEAM usually is located in Program Files (x86) > Steam > SteamApps > common > BattleBlock Theater > GameData > UserFaces) You can also create your own levels and publish them in the Steam Workshop for other players to download and play.So what are you waiting for?

Other than that, feel free buy this game and play it if you have some spare time and money!)\n",

      "Holy S*** I don't even know where to start reviewing this game. I don't even know if I recommend it or not at this point.Coming from someone who has a decent amount of experience with Unity (The engine this game was made with) I can tell you the developers spent maybe two weeks at most making this. I'm 99% sure the only real work that went into this was the small amount of coding it took to program the movement and weapons (which still isn't even well done). Everything else has either been bought from the unity asset store or downloaded for free. I really can't tell if it's laziness or straight up incompetence but almost no effort has gone into polishing the game. It's the little details that no one normally notices that makes literally all the difference, such as: The gun not rendering over the pause menu. Having more than one 30 second song for the entire game. All the menu fonts being the same size. Somewhat decent audio mixing.  Gun models facing the right direction. Clear and concise UI design. The day/night cycle not being an instant change. I could keep going for hours...But by far the biggest issue with this game is its mechanic design. It feels as though the devs never once stopped to think about how the game feels to a potential player or what would make the game more interesting. absolutly no research into the design of other games and what makes them succesfull was done and no time was taken to ensure the game was engaging. It all comes back to the devs spending nowhere near enough time in development. \"Oh man I'm getting pretty bored of making this game\" \"ehhh, it's technically a finished product. let's just dump it on Steam, make our money back and do something else\"There are so many issues that are basic game design 101 it's physically painful to try and list them all. There is zero context as to who you are or why there are zombies everywhere.  When one level ends you are (without warning or context) teleported to the next level. Every level is exactly the same with a different map. The \"Boss fights\" are so bad I can't even describe them. You start with nowhere near enough ammo.  Zombies just randomly spawn around the map, sometimes in plain sight of the player. The minimap doesn't rotate with the player making it impossible to tell where enemies are coming from. Every level is 15 minutes even though they have maybe 2 minutes at most of content.  The progression and unlock system is useless. Nothing you unlock gives you a feeling of progress as every gun functions basically identically. I got enough money in three levels to unlock every character and weapon in the entire game. As I said before the UI looks like complete garbage and is extremely confusing. I swear everytime I play the FOV gets smaller to a point where I can barely even play. Because of its spaghetti code, the game struggles to maintain 30 FPS (despite looking terrible) on my upper middle level rig that can run most modern games on high at above 60. etc..However this, like all terrible games, has a few positives that makes it almost (key word almost) worth the time and money you waste on it. I recommend you and a bunch friends buy this game when it's on sale just to laugh at and to have a good time. I'm not gonna lie though, I did have a little bit of fun while playing it. And to Digital Homicide (even though you most likey wont read this). I understand that you have a dream of being a respected game developer and it hurts when people harshly criticise or even attack you for your work, but everything people say about you and your games, for the most part, is true. And until you start taking your time and making games that people accually want to play, you will get endless amounts of s*** and trust me, suing big youtubers who give you a negative review will never improve your image. To do that you need to show your worthy of a good image instead of trying to buy your way there.\n",

      "This review is brought to you by RandomselectTV. To view the review and other articles, please visit our website: http://randomselecttv.com/impression-outland/Platformers are fun, and so is exploration. Both of those go together like peanut butter and jelly. Outland is no exception. Developed my Housemarque, Outland originally was released for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network back in 2011, but the game is just now making its way to PC. Now before going any further, it is crucial to point out that while it’s published by Ubisoft on the Xbox 360, Housemarque is self-publishing on Steam and as a result Uplay is nowhere to be seen.StoryThe game starts with the nameless hero having strange dreams and visions of the past. Thinking it may be illness, the hero turns to medicine which proves to be ineffective. He turns to a shaman who told him stories of a huge battle that took place 30,000 years ago between a Great Hero and Two sisters of Chaos, who control Light from the sun and the other controls the darkness of the moon. The battle imprisoned the sisters, but it also took the life of the Great Hero. The shamantells him how the hero is the reincarnation of that Great Hero, and only he can stop the event from reoccurring.PlayabilityThe player controls a nameless hero throughout numerous stages and areas. Completing these areas involves running through the level once to hit a level or switch followed by navigating back through the level to advance, but that makes it sound simple. I can assure you that you will be in for a surprise. Outland is difficult and sometimes infuriating. While the first area may seem easy to begin with, difficulty increases the further you progress. Oh but it’s not just using melee attacks to kill the various enemies and endless amount of spiders, Outland quickly throws you in to the Bullet-Hell and puzzle genres. One of Outlands key features is the ability to switch colors, or ‘spirits’ as they are referred to.Switching from red to blue is crucial to navigating your way through the beautifully designed levels. You will find yourself wondering “how?” several times throughout the game. Rapid spirit switching, wall jumps, slides, the works. It is a tough game. Enemies will kill you, opposite spirit projectiles will kill you, and spiders WILL kill you. Outland is tough, but it is very fun. Now we should probably talk about how the game actually runs. It’s safe to say the port is a very good one. I’ve had a few issues where the game crashes after tabbing out for a short period, but so far that has been a very rare occurrence. Since the game originally released on consoles, using a controller is recommended here. The keyboard controls feel very cramped for the many abilities you can unlock.All the keys are just grouped together in a very non user friendly way, sadly those keys cannot be rebound outside of switching to the only other layout, which isn’t much better. Control issues aside, performance is very good. It’s a 2D Platformer so most anything will be able to run the game. I haven’t noticed any major issues outside of some very rare tiny glitches, for the most part though the game performs and feels fantastic.VisualsSimply put, the game is gorgeous. Amazing backgrounds mix so well with the contrasting Blue and Red spirit colors. Outland presents itself perfectly. The moment you start playing the game, you can see all of the artistic talent that went into the game. 2D Platformers tend to always have a very unique art style, and Outland is just another example of that. The silhouette of the player and the various enemies is reminiscent of Limbo, but are highlighted by vivid shades of Red and Blue, and occasionally yellow.FeaturesSingleplayer: Campaign Only, Metroidvania Style Story.Co-Op: Campaign Modified Co-Op, Arcade Style Challenges, Co-Op Challenge Rooms Steam Achievements: Specialized Tasks Awarding Honor StampsSteam Cloud: Ability To Back Up & Load Saves From The CloudFull Controller Support: Full Controller Support for Xinput Enabled Devices.Steam Trading Cards: Tradable & Marketable Digital Cards Related To Medium Awarded Base On Playtime.SoundscapeOutlands scores are composed by Ari Pulkkinen who is known for such games as the Trine franchise and most recently Resogun. As well as composing the scores, he also contributed to the general sound design. The game sounds good, sword slashes provide a satisfying sense of contact when you attack an enemy and everything else mixes perfectly with the setting to help immerse the player into the game.MultiplayerThe multiplayer component of the game becomes more and more fleshed out as you go farther in the single campaign. There are certain elements that unlock as you encounter them throughout the game, the first of these modes is to do the campaign cooperatively, the changes from single player are mostly to switches or any specific advancement article is made to be needed to be activated by both parties. You are given complete free roam from your partner and not required to stay on screen, this helps with exploration as you cover more ground. The only gripe about the multiplayer was that it has this rubber banding issue where the game kept trying to sync what we both would be doing constantly. This led to some lag as it always appeared that animations were a frame or so behind then correct before going behind again.Parting ShotOutland is a fun game. Exploration feels fun and it feels good when you are rewarded for going off the beaten path. The music and sound ties perfectly with the gorgeous stages and background to create some very nice eye and ear candy. Combat plays a key role in the game. You have a basic melee attack as well as unlockable abilities such as the slide. Combos are very possible, and probably the most satisfying element of the combat system. A simple slide will throw the enemy in the air allowing you to set up for juggle combos that feel straight out Street Fighter or Marvel vs Capcom. Unfortunately, that novelty wears off fairly quickly.Once you figure out the best combos to use, combat feels more like a routine and a choir, then something you might look forward too. Where the combat fails, the exploration makes up for those shortcomings. Wall jumping and spirit switching around the stages can be rewarding. It’s not always best to follow the straight and narrow, you are rewarded for exploring. Whether you find some of the 40+ collectable masks which can be used for unlocking concept art or upgrading abilities, or finding a totem which allows you to pay your collect coins for a very helpful health upgrade.Combat becomes repetitive and feels like a choir that sometimes can be avoided, with the exception of boss battle which honestly are fun. The game shines in its tough and thought provoking puzzles and landscapes. Feeling that great relief once you get past that one puzzle you finally beat is something that some games today fail to even provide, but Outland does. I feel good about recommending Outland. Only being held back by the games length and the dull combat, Outland proves to be a very fun and satisfying mix of Metroidvania and Puzzle games.\n",

      "I tried the multiplayer and really wanted to like it. I had hoped that they would actually do something different with it. I'll admit the specialists, thrusters, and a few new weapons make it slightly different, but at the end of the day it's still the same ridiculously unbalanced game where the fastest firing weapon wins. With the exception of sniper rifles. HOWEVER The zombies is pretty fun (This coming from the guy who doesn't even like zombies mode.) So if you like zombies, or have a group of friends to play this with in a private lobby than this game is for you. (I guess if you are one of those ♥♥♥♥boys that just buy it every year it's pretty good for you too.)TL;DR: Same game as it always was and will be. Fun zombies. Modding tools will come out in 2016. (looking forward to that)\n",

      "Now Payday is great in my books. The multiplayer games that I enjoy the most are the co-op team based games and this right here what I wanted. Its also a rare sight to see a game about pulling off heists and I immensely enjoy every heist the game has to offer. The combat is fun and visually the game is nice but the only problem like most online games have is it's lasting appeal. There are very few multiplayer games that are fun to play by themselves and sadly Payday are one of those games. Despite that it is fun to play with friends.8/10 A fun co-operative shooter with fun missions, good quality gameplay, and a unique setting to fix that heist itch.UPDATE: I don't usually update but I would just like to point out this game does indeed not have microtransactions. Happy trails everyone.\n",
      "This game is quite fun. You can usually get this game dirt cheap on sales and they add content quite often. The combat is a little on the simple side but still fun. The best part about this game are the characters and their abilities. Each character has their own playstyle, personality and theme song (yes theme song) and you can play in whatever way feels comfortable. The cartoony saturday morning cartoon style is great and the music is okay. The theme songs and the opening is what you're gonna remember in the sound department. This game has a large community to back it up which is essential for online games no matter how much I wouldn't like to admit it. The only thing I wish is they would make more maps. 4 is okay but quite limited.This game is a good 8/10 for the fun it brings and the zany nature it brings which I quite like. A 2D MOBA that's fun with friends. Plus hyper intelligent Soviet space monkey with a jetpack.\n",
      "So Reigns is a cute little card game where you have to rule a kingdom as king for as long as possible. You do this by managing between the church, populace, army and the treasury. They're respresented by a metre and so if any one of them is too high or too low then you'll face one of many types of deaths. It's not that complicated of a game but the hook for it is that the more you play the more you uncover. You have goals to accomplish like ruling for king for sixty years or be involved in an affair. You unlock new decks that carry out new questlines and encounters which helps spice things up every now and again. This is quite a nice little game with a fun idea. It does it well and the presentation is well done plus it's one of those games with good water cooler talk so you can tell your friends weird stories on how you met the Devil or how you arranged a wedding for some werewolves. The price of admission is also very nice. It does get a bit repetitive after awhile so I'd suggest playing it in short bursts or maybe get the iOS or Android version. It looks very much designed for those platforms. Still as is it's a good game that'll give a couple of hours of entertainment. I give it a 7/10.\n",
      "this game is good fun to play with friends\n",
      "Great game, heaps of fun to play with friends only downside is you will need an above average PC to play above 10 FPS in the state its in right now. Still a great game and will most likly fix this issue in the near future.\n",
      "This is a good but buggy game i can recommend that you pay the $10 if you are wondering why when people are saying this is F2P later you get $36 of free content for paying to support the devs and yes you are paying for closed betaThe Pros-it's fun and with friends its quite a blast-it's $10 pretty good price to support the game-heaps of unlockables -feels like the good olden days of Combat arms before it was crap-have not encounterd a hacker yet -community seems to not be toxic-non P2W game you need to pay for absoultly nothing if you want it and you get alot of ingame credits so you usally can get the gear you want without paying The cons -some guns feel extremly unbalenced-it hasnt got stable ping for me on any servers -the game has a very small community currently im hoping more people will buy this-its a bit buggy-the menu is quite clunkyoverall i would recommend this game and i hope more people do so we get an larger community whilst supporting the devs to contiune this game it has real potential and i quite enjoy it\n",

      "This game is very fun. All the races in this game are great.Tips to see which race you would most likely like:Eldar: If you feel like tricking people and giving surprises than going strate in the battle, this would be for you.Orks: If you think millions of units stricking as a swarm, This would be for you (waaagh)Space marines: If you like to move to places fast (deep striking) and having some backup when need, this is for you.Dark eldar: if you like collecing souls to build up abilitys you can use on the battle feild, this would be for you.Imperial Guard: if you feel like holding out in a area to slowly get your super weapon (baneblade), this would be for you.Tau: if you like letting melee troups charge in and having some ranged units at the back, this would be for you.Sisters of battle: if you feel like capturing points and slowly building holy powers, this would be for you.Necrons: If you feel like slowly building a strong slow army, This would be for you. (hint: have a friend to protect you if you want or you will get killed very early on)Chaos marines: if you feel like using dark powers and all tipes of demons, this would be for you.When you fine a race you fit in, this game gets even more fun. I love how the game creators made a race to fit everyones needs. (you can even like more than one race. For example: I love Tau and necrons.)Oh and if you want to play multiplayer with the race you like, find the game they were added in and it will give you the cd code to play as them.If you get bored, talk to me on steam and I can show you a mod that will make this game 10x better.\n",

      "This game is amazing. Its a 'Casual' RTS set in world war 2. You have standard infantry, tanks, all that jazz.

Let me throw a 'nade onto it. *throws AT Grenade*'Me': Nice *Tank blows up*'Asken': Indeed.\"The tank chassis that is now exploded proceeds to destroy my squads cover, killing my medic and leaving my squad open to MG-42 fire. \"'Me': SMOOOOOOOOOTH.'Asken': ♥♥♥♥ off.And this is one of the many moments i have had, and will be having in the future.

      "An incredibly fun and entertaining game, but should be played in a party with friends as often as possible to avoid getting stuck vs a 4 man party. Also, the game forces you into the Goliath Tutorial when you first boot it up, and it takes FOREVER to load, dont worry, it hasn't frozen, it's still loading, it just takes obscene amounts of time.\n",

I love to play this because i love stratigy (without stratigy i would be a mindless thug playing Call of Duty no offence). Me and my friend think it would be the perfect game to play for geography in school because it has some geological stuff in it (don't steal this idea or unless you put my name in for example thank you Ethan/Behemoth for suggesting this). Deffinately play it and maybe even challenge me if you dare and yea. recap Deffinately play it challenge me if you want and watch my youtube (soon going to be uploading Civilizations once i fix my recorder) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3SBiZrI_bzEb8XUpWpxjg\n",

Then after watching Dota 2 reporter i started to realise how fun and enjoying Dota can be.At first i was called a NOOB for not playing the game right. Then i asked if i could party up with some people that i met in my team. They gladly invited me then i was apart of a little group of dota 2 players.

      "Rust, a game that is mixed with Minecraft and the zombie mod Dayz. This game is great with friends when building and raiding other peoples bases.

      "So I live in Australia, Im in a different time zone compared to the majority of people that play this game so I'm usally lucky if I find even 1 game that has enough players to start. But then when we get to playing my ping is around 400-700, so my experiance isn't as great as it could've been. But still this game is quite fun. It's not really that scary allowing it to be more enjoyable than well, lets just say u wont be goin \"ohhh its 3 spoopy 5 meh!!!11!!\" Its a great game to play over a group skype call, or somthing along those lines.Now the REALLY BIG CON is the games lack of players (atleast in my region) as I stated earlier most players are in a different timezone, meanung i have to up rlly late at night or rlly early in the morn to find a ton of servers. Oh and its price, I feel like at $15 there should be a tad more.But overall if you have lots of friends and arent living In any other country but the US u should get this game.This was a rlly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reveiw ._.\n",
      "a fun game for you and your friends to play togethor, and the soundtrack is amazing\n",
      "This game is probably my favourite purchase on Steam. A great mixture between FPS, Strategy and Horror, Depth is a great game to play with friends or solo. The atmosphere of the game is great, with the enviornments and gameplay making you feel alone in the vast ocean which is actually really terrifying, especially when your heartbeat picks up when you have no idea where the shark is. Definetely a game to play with headphones in.\n",
      "Awesome Game to play with friends. Co-op is the best. In multiplayer, everyone just camps in corners of rooms.\n",
      "Amazing Game! Super Tactical.Good to play with friends as you have people to cry with when you get absolutely dominated by the easy AI.10/10 would cry again.I do have one questions for some AI war veterans.How do I make mark 4 ships?

      "I would highly recommend this game to anyone. but it does has flaws but hey, it's still in early access. in order to play with friends you port port forward your router. but there will be dedicated servers 3.0. so that will make things much more easier to play with your friends. I will would unturned a 9/10. it's a awsome game. and plus it's free after all. you always try it.\n",
      "Chaotic fun, it's pretty rough around the guts at moment but something to kill time if you've got friends over!\n",

      "Fun game worth the money i have about almost 300 hours very fun if you and you're friends play together make a server or look up terraria servers for you and you're friends to join.Fun because you can play for hours and look up how to get a certain npc and get the require ments and finally get the npc at first i was a Mincraft fan and hated terraria for \"riping minecraft off\" but mincraft was expensive and saw terraria and said \"why not test it out\" bought the game play for like 6 hours straight the next day woke up and played the whole day and said \"terraria is very fun\" and didint play minecraft anymore only terraria once again defenently worth the money.\n",
      "Game is great if you're in to the PVP side of all these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t survivalist games out there.Drop in, gear up in under 5 minutes and kill as many people as you can. Australian servers are severely lacking in players on 2 + 5 stack servers, so if you've got a friend to play with be prepared to lag it out on the US servers.CTRL + M, press it when you get in to lobby, for some reason people get a kick out of spamming the ♥♥♥♥ out of voice chat and using police car sirens to ♥♥♥♥ everybody off. CTRL + M mutes everything, press it again when you deploy.Items and skins in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing pointless, there is no spectator mode which would drastically increase my opinion of this game. For example, if you join a 5 player server and you die, thats it. You don't get to spectate the rest of the game through your teammate's eyes, it just shows a camera viewing your dead body.. basic as ♥♥♥♥.I'll give it a 4/10, but that's because it seems to be everything I wanted from DayZ without all the zombie survivalist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. If you like that ♥♥♥♥ then shove a tamagotchi up your ♥♥♥♥.\n",
      "I bought this game after a friend I've played many hours of Arma 2 + 3 and DayZ started playing it.If you don't like minecraft, you won't like this game. It's just another block sandbox crafter/builder and I can't see what any of the fuss is about.\n",
      "Highly reccomend this game, its amazing so many things and its so fun to play with friends. buy it.\n",
      "Really, really enjoyed this game. The first time I got it I never played it for about 1 year, then I had nothing else to played so I tried it out again. Turns out it acutally went from a boring old game to one of my favourite and most played game. This game supports all kind of gameplay, you can just mess around with friends and gain a good laugh, you can play by your self and feel great when you accomplish a mission, you can play online and meet a great and enjoyable community and the list goes on. Overall a great game and well worth a shot.\n",
      "The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs.I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end.I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now.The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player....You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies.But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just......... But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously\n",
      "In this game, you use an arm-mounted buzzsaw and hand-lightning to kill sky-racists in 1912, while your sidekick opens portals to other universes and has a giant robot bird for a best friend.Holy ♥♥♥♥, this is fantastic. 9/10.\n",
      "Jesus, this is a tough one to review.I have extremely polarised opinions abut this game, because the best parts are fantastic, which makes the worst parts even more terrible. The story, writing and gameplay from the original game are back, with some new cast members to either be eaten or saved. That's about as good as it gets, however, because (especially in the second half of the game) the developers seem to have forgotten what made the first one so good.The game is as brutal as the first, but without purpose. In the first one, characters died as a result of your failure to protect them. In this one, people die because the developers said so, and because they want to show how 'dramatic' they can be, forgetting that the key point of drama is audience involvement.The game allows you to brood for ages about whether to reconnect with your old friends, or what to do when your plans fail, and then it'll pull out of nowhere a choice that you can't possibly be prepared for. I remember one particular section in which you have to help one of two endangered allies, but both choices led to the same outcome!I don't want to say that it's all bad. The point-and-click+ style of gameplay is still charming as ever, and there were a few moment of genuine gut-wrench.Just play your cards well when you think about buying this game, and be prepared to slog through some really hard crap to get to the good bits.7/10.\n",
      "could be fun if you had friends\n",
      "The game is awesome.. It is Free to Play but it is not Pay to Win.. You required a good skills in the game to win... It is fast pace which is nice.. Would recommend it to my friends and family. The only downsize of the game is that you need to spend real money to customize the look of ur mech other than that it is not bad..\n",
      "ONE TEAM ONE DREAMJust tbh the first few times you play will make you turned off from the game as the environment is extremely harsh, but playing with friends is extremely enjoyable.\n",
      "I wouldn't be joking if I said this game was good. Its fun, but make sure you have a group of friends as sometimes it gets a little boring by yourself.9/10 would buy all the DLCs (if you really wanna, your cash, your decisions) and Payday's on discount too :)\n",
      "I would recommend this game-But.... There is always a but..My friends and I struggle so much just having a multipler server between us, it should be easy and quick not taking an hour and rage quitting because it not worth it anymore.Games should be quick to join, my friends and I have only successfully had a multiplayer experience one.Thanks and would much like if some could help out on the servers and try and figure out why we are struggling so much!!!\n",
      "Oddly enough, the tab says \"recommend to friends.\"I can't think of a single person on my friends list who has not played TF2 before.I've played TF2 for around 3500 hours now since I first started, and I still play it every couple of days when I get the time. This is my go-to game. Valve has taken every oppurtunity to improve on the gameplay and/or the quality of this game. It is, to this day, my favorate game, as it is for millions of gamers out there.Of course, you all know this already...and if you haven't played this game yet, what's stopping you?Trust me, it'll be worth the 10 gigabytes of download.\n",

      "This game is absolutly amazing ! It's new so do expect a bug here and there but for what you get it is completely worth the $20 !! Heart-racing moments and utter relief at a seconds notice leaves you as a player sitting there completly overwhelmed at how much this game gets you thinking, the ammount of focus required and the communication required when playing with friends and even with randoms somehow having to help one another and communicate. I honestly cannot think of any flaws with this game what so ever obviously besides the bugs however that si to b expected of a brand new game. In my eyes this game deserves a solid 8.5/10 or even a 9. To my friend that bought this for me I thankyou for the amazing experience you have given me and for all the future heartstopping moments and laughs between our group.\n",
      "This game is worth the $5 dollars! It's like DayZ but without zombies and is a very playable. If you want to play a DayZ like game, then this is for you. It also runs good on very low end PC's if you do happen to have one. Pros:-Runs well on older/lower end PC's-Very playable-Crafting is available-Updates everyday-Very fun with friends-Graphics are decent Cons:-Low player base-Everything is still very alpha-Clunky animations-No customizable settings other than graphics-Spectating after death which tells you exactly where other players are and what they have on them-Many players are Russian (From my experience) and most of them (Not trying to be offensive, yet again from my experience) are very agressive and will KOS. -Server hoppingI recommend you buy this game nevertheless as it will greatly increase the player base and will encourage the developers to keep working on the game. \n",
      "I love the fallout series. I was also extremelly hyped for this game. It's incredibly fun, but has its flaws.Pros:- Combat is no longer dull and boring- Wasteland is a good as ever- Addicting for the first day of playtime or so- Once you get the hang of settlement building its pretty fun- Companion quests are fun, as well as getting them all to romace/best friend status.- Power armour actually feels like power armour, not just a bad metal suit. Power armor modding is also worth the time. The mechanic is balanced by having to scavenge for fusion cores to keep your power armour functioning like how its meant to.- Voiced Protagonist: At first the voiced protagonist was hated, the game came out and people thought it was good, now people see it and think; eh. BUT IMO it does express the emotional tones this game wants to portray. When the character is meant to be angry, hes angry, sad, sad and etc. You can hear the emotion in the voice he or her is trying to portray. - Weapon modding is fun, and it does make a difference. But after a while it can become tedious.- Locations and map: The map is big enough is full of unique and interesting locations. One of my favourites is The Glowing Sea, where the atomic bomb was dropepd - Graphics: Personally, I think the graphics are just great but keep in mind I'm running at ultra with 60fps. some people might differ from me.Cons:- Dialouge: At first i didn't think it was so bad, but now I see its a major flaw. You only get 4 choices, which are YES (good guy), NO (being a ♥♥♥♥), Sarcastic (Sometimes ♥♥♥♥ sometimes good) and question? Question is redundant because someone could tell you something about a topic or thing you already know a lot about, yet you still have the option to \"  \"?- Story: No matter what you do, you will end up with the same ending and story, regardless of your choices but slightly different (depending on the faction you side with will determine your slightly altered final mission battle ). No matter what you'll either be a good guy helping people, or a guy with an attitude. No matter what, the game will take you to the same place. The story also feels rushed and incredibly short. Withing your first 2 hours of story or so you're already thrown into power armor, when the other games took a long time to get you into it.  But atleast power armor makes a difference now. With 81 hours in i also cannot find any more side quests.- Replay Value: As mentioned above, the endings and story do not change significantly depending on choices you make. Don't expect multiple endings or storylines like New Vegas had, thats not here. Since the story never changes (just like war), it feels like there is no replay value besides changing genders, the game still would be boring doing the exact same thing.- NOT ME PERSONALLY, but bugs: A lot of people have reported bugs in their game, I haven't expierienced any but always keep that in mind.tl/dr: Most mechanics are improved, making the game really fun. But the story options and ending are just lackluster, when its predicesor new vegas showed how a fallout story line should go (that was developed by obsidian though, not bathesda). Its still worth a buy and play though. Hopefully DLC might fix some story issues, but at least it'll add more things to do as well as other stories to complete and areas to explore. I still very much reccommend playing it because its still a blast to play. 7/10FOLLOW UP:AFTER DLC:So, as you can see, my invested hours in the game has rissen since I wrote this review. My points have not changed dramatically but, I noticed that casual exploring invested me a little further into the game. But, DLC relies on my new playtime greatly. At the moment, there are 4 DLC's. I hate how most of our DLC's are monthly releases and focused on settlements. Before you say \"Be greatful etc, youre getting DLC!\" I personally don't believe, along with many others, that settlement building DLC is entirely worth the money into a season pass. Previously, in the older fallouts, DLC would take 2-3 months or so to release and would be story/location driven, making for incredibly fun quests and senarios. I would much prefer Bethesda to take their time developing more story/location based DLC's, rather than pumping out monthy DLC, with arguably 3.5/6 DLC's being settlement based.  These are the DLCS so far:Automation: Allows you to build companion/defense robots. I say this counts as settlement building because of the building element. This dlc has a quest accompanying it but its incredibly short, its closer to a linear side mission than anything. Robots are fun, but it gets old. 6.5/10Wasteland workshop: Build arena's, concrete structures and have settlers fight animals or each other. This dlc is ok, I'd say its only worth it if you want a gorilla or deathclaw or another creature patrolling your settlement. Tbh, this feels more like a mod than DLC. Should be free, its good for concrete and creatures. Average, 5/10Far Harbor: This... This is what DLC should be. A brand new location, weapons story, side missions, interesting characters, locations and quests. This is arguably better than the main story due to all of the possible choices you can make within this DLC. This DLC is incredibly worth it and I pray to god Nuka world either succeed this or be on par. Definately a 8.5/10Contraptions: TBC *Seems alright I guess, idk what ill need a conver belt for. Also, elevators seem to be the only realisticly cool thing*Vault Building: TBC *Initial thoughts: the idea is cool, however it is basically fallout shelter in fallout 4. I dont really have a problem with it besides the fact it just doesnt make sence to me. This kinda seems like a gimmick, arguably building things is way to simple but wood and metal you can get away with. Just building vaults outta some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ materials just doesnt seem right to me*Nuka world:  TBC *Inital thoughts: New map, new story, with the option of being evil WITH an effect on the commonwealth?? Sign me up*MODS:Yeah, they basically improve the game to your liking. Can't say much else besides it more than likely will add a lot of hours to your playtime.\n",
      "This game is an almost perfect zombie FREE ROAM survival RPG, yes I said RPG! Almost perfect is that you can be bitten and scratched and recover then the next time you go down, you get ripped in half, you cant really get infected. Anyway, you take the roal (for a little while) who came back from a fishing trip with his friend Ed. When they return they notice that people are turning to cannibalism, but later realise the zombie \"Walker\" apocalypes is among them. They find 4 survivors and do some tutorial missions and they die, you find another survivor, a radio and go to to a church full of survivors. When you make friends at your camp, you can switch to them and gather more recorces. If you are a fan of zombie games/movies/tv I HIGHLY recommend this.\n",
      "This is an AMAZING GAME I wish i had more friends to play with.\n",
      "You want friends to play with and kill other people with guns? Nope. You want to be naked and kill someone with a rock? Nope. Build something while naked and with friends to kill people with rocks? Nope.Any survival game you see this days is about Zombies, A post-apocalyptic world, MP or All of them combined. The Long Dark is quite a different.You're going to be surviving by yourself. You will die horribly or just stupidly. You can survive for a week and just die embarassingly from freezing because of a blizzard. You can get eaten by wolves. or just starve to death in a matter of I don't know. A few hours? This is what a survival game is. It has a lot of potential. I can go on and on about what they should add. But i'm pretty sure most people have that covered. Love it! <3\n",
      "*SPOILER ALERT m8's*Far Cry 3 is more of an experience than a game, one second you're partying on an island everything is smooth, next second you an your friends decide to go 'skydiving' on another 'remote' island, not so bad? But when you hit the ground you are ♥♥♥♥ed, this insane pirate called 'Vaas' ambushes and captures you and your friends who then plans to sell you into slavery. You wake up, tied up next to your older brother 'Grant' locked up in a bamboo cage, and to the right of you is Vaas, he then starts giving you a lecture about all this crazy ♥♥♥♥, your brother Grant (who served many years in the military), manages to get loose of the rope, unties you and calls a guard over to the cage, he then knocks out the guard, takes his key and opens the cage. You then have to slowly sneak past the guards in the compound until you reach the exit, unfortunately as you are escaping your brother is shot in the neck by Vaas, he then gives you the oppurtunity the run out of the compound while he and his guards are shooting at you, you run while bullets are flying past your head, you run through a rope bridge and luckily a helicopter containing a machine gunner starts firing at you, you sprint as fast as you can, but the bridge snaps, you fall in the water and knocked unconscious. Moments after a man named Dennis finds you and aids you, he then gives you a machete, information on Vaas, and a 1911 handgun. The game then starts from here.\n",
      "I want to start by saying that I do have fun with this game, and some times it's the same way that some people have fun by putting needles into their private parts.There is so much that is good about this game and in the same breath i have to also say that there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed.1. THERE IS NO CONTROL REBINDING! that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls. Really?2. The Infinate vault hopping thing. there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window. 3. Perk Ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby. how many times i have come across a high lvl Meg with Adrenaline, seriously that perk is so OP it is not funny, full heal and run speed +150%, at it's best it will full heal from dying state... are you serious? AND after she gets to lvl 30, she can teach it to other survivors.On the flip side lets look at a few killer perks, Insidious for example, after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect, or no heart beat to hear, untill you move or act again.Dearstalker, the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance awayAnd Iron Grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them.These are, in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have.If you are going to buy this game, be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game. Ther is serious Potential in this game, and i want to see it brought into being, and that is why i bought it... Evolve did something similar before, but this game has the ability to offer so much more.I just hope that the devs hear what the community is saying, and make this something special.\n",
      "If you take enjoyment out of being a masochist and killing your friends in a game, then this is probably a game that you would enjoy... A LOT! Running as a parody to a lot of pop culture sci-fi and fantasy icons, Magicka will have you either laughing your ♥♥♥ off, crying tears of frustration, or throwing your laptop out the window because of the sheer difficulty of some of the levels and mobs (not to mention friends that blast you with that Summon Death, or Crash to Desktop spells...)Overall, the main campaign has 12 levels to get though and these can be tackled solo, or with up to three friends for carnage against the enemies, or your friends. Are you frustrated at a friend for sleeping with your girlfriend? Blow them up, and don't revive them! Simple.\n",
      "POSITIVESGreat Game! Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a ♥♥♥♥ ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has ♥♥♥♥ internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I'm all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!\n",
      "really well done game, lots of fun weith friends but the only think that was a dissapointment would have to be that the graphics didn't change from the last payday but still is a great game to play.\n",
      "One of the MMORPGS I am still playing to this day. Though I do not fervently pursue every inch and corner of this particular game. It arguably has proven itself a very difficult game to drop as a result of events and decent action.To speak about this game in more particular detail, you would not discover a game filled to the brinks with story and lore. You are a lone warrior of a long forgotten race under the order and jurisdiction of one particular woman who calls herself Lotus. The tutorial will give you a glimpse of the story until you are given your own ship, where the story boils down to sweet FA because except quests that gives you Warframes and event plot lines, all you would be left doing is finding more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials so you can craft them, grind them and use them in your quest of discovering more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials. You can also throw your own clan's development progress and the contributions you can make towards a game faction into it as well, adding more time to this particular grindfest.So why would I even recommend this game? Well, because the action doesn't disappoint, though the sweet satisfaction of completing and fully modifying and tricking out your weapons and Warframe of choice is mostly rewarded just by a greater statistical number, the complete and total decimation of your enemies is sure to bring a happy smile on any action genre enthusiasts, with bloodied and pretty gory corpses to boot (optional) as you can be sure you are the one that led to their complete and utter mutilation.The boss battle is usually hit or miss, with bosses that are simply bullet sponges to bosses that requires a little bit more finesse, like bosses that teleports and bosses who only intakes damage in certain areas, Normally, you wouldn't have any gripes with more difficult bosses, but when you are grinding for a specific part for something you want and the random number generator have forsaken you in dropping the loot you desire over and over, I think you would grow to hate such technicalities that serve no other purpose than stopping you from getting that sweet four barreled shotgun.There is currently a total of 23 Warframes available in-game, with harder, better, faster, stronger version of some frames available for grinding already, if there is a particular suit you like, you might just be able to grab a even spiffier version of it. Every suit does indeed come with 4 unique abilities of it's own and is highly customisable in terms of cosmetics and specific combat capabilities and parameters.  Every grindable gear, equipment or companion caps out at level 30, with 8 slots for mods (collectible cards that improve stats or utility in someway) each item total. There's more stuff out there then I would care to mention, but you'd find out if you play it no? Just know it probably means more grinding, better damages and maybe just your own personal pet dog, that and maybe space combat with you in a suit that can fly, but hey, I find that to be more of a gimmick in comparison to me pinning a wave of enemies under one powerful arrow, as their mid sections split, separating their body parts into two halves with their decapitated torsos nailed to the wall, all from just one well placed shot from my bow.You have three slots for weaponries, a primary slot for your power hungry dreams like snipers, assault rifles, shotguns or even bows. A secondary slot for that dual-wielding fantasy of yours, or maybe just having to use something because you ran out of primary ammo, we are talking dual revolvers, pistols, shurikens (ninja stars) and automatic repeaters. Lastly, what's a ninja without a melee weapon? Pick something traditional like a katana, a claymore or a long sword or go ham with electronic whips, wolverine claws and grim reaper scythes.Frankly, none of that will drag you into the game more than a mate and a growing clan that needs your attention because of all the exclusive weaponries in it, game factions because of their unique weapons and cosmetics. But more importantly, the timed events that will give you stronger versions of grindable mods and weapons, you can feel pretty left out with out those stuff, but then there is the free trade market in game that will let you grab those stuff you can't grind for anymore (at least for awhile) for real actual money, because there is always someone selling if you are patient enough.If someone tells you all of the stuff in this game is grindable, that isn't technically true, because there are certain things that haven't seen the light of day ever since a certain time period, you have event mods and weapons that are ungrindable outside of events, originally grindable stuff taking out of the maps they can be obtained from, stuff being retired from the game completely at certain points and if you really care for it, unique cosmetics that are sold in real money bundles.This is why I consider this game to be borderline addictive, you are forced to revisit this game from time to time because the game refuses to let you go with its consistent weapon, Warframe and event updates with stuff being retired, made rarer and exclusive by different varying circumstances.But then, neither will you let go of it completely, because you know that friend of yours is quite keen to see just how much damage that fully customised weapons of yours do and you'd be happy to oblige him.Other things I've neglected to mention:Potentially excellent graphics with a decent computer.Four man cooperation gameplay all around, with specific eight man maps out and some more in development.PVP.Clan Alliances and being able to take certain areas under your jurisdiction while being able to tax those who run missions on it.\n",
      "Guns of icarus Online is a multiplayer which is fully hectic. There are guns and flying and a variety of large maps. The one thing I like most is that you can play with friends (duh). I highly recommend this game to people who like flying, shooting, multiplayer and playing with friends.\n",

He uses them to attack you while you loot the enemies you just killed..

      "So normally I don't really write reviews, but this is one of those times where I feel like I should.RWBY: Grimm Eclipse is a pretty freaking amazing game for being in Early Access. I have followed this game since its inception and it has not let me down yet. GE (Grimm Eclipse) is a hack and slash game which can be played with upto four people. The basis of GE, RWBY, is an animated show released by RoosterTeeth, and this game shows how amazing that company can be.The story is still pretty bare bones, but is constantly being added to as the updates roll out. However, the story in GE is seperate from RWBY, from Volume 2 of the show on. This is great as it allows the devs to have fun with the IP they got.The gameplay, where do i begin, is freaking awesome. Think Metal Gear Rising: Revengance with 4 highschool girls in a world where the normal rules of physics are thrown out of the window. Each character has their own play style, and moves to complement said style. Personally I play as Weiss Schnee. She is more of the mage character, as she is more support and area based with her moves than the rest of her team. While i do mainly play as Weiss, i have unlocked all the special skills for every character. While it can take some time if you do it on your own, playing with others, whether its friends or random people, is much more enjoyable and will net you more kills.Graphically it looks breath taking. This game is built in unity, so be prepared for bright colours and amazing models. There are a few different graphical settings: Potato, for if you dont have the best PC/Laptop, Normal, and Ultra, which is what i run. There is no V-Sync, however with the right settings it will run at a buttery smooth 60FPS.All in all this game is really enjoyable and if you have the money, give it a go, you will not regret it!I rate this game a 9.5/10, but keep in mind this is still an early access game.\n",
      "At first I wasn't to intreged by this game but my friend got me interested when I was skyping with him while he was playing it and the insanity of it sounded fun so I downloaded and I have been playing alot since. I highly recommend it, it is a combination of \"World of Tanks\" and Lego.\n",

It's an addiction.I've lost most of my friends, my job, dropped out of uni and forgot to eat and shower for who knows how long, but it was all worth it.10/10 would thoroughly recommend.Even though the upcoming expansion may actually kill me.\n",

      "Rust is a survival game in which you must gather resources and craft items in order to survive. But sadly there is an element of human interaction which can be both friendly or hostile. You will soon find that everyone is HOSTILE. I do not know why but other players rarely if ever show reciprocity. It is quite demeaning to spend 2 hours building a base and crafting for it to just get destroyed by rage-kids with rocket launchers. This game has a nice concept, despite its good intentions, other players are a large error factor which ruins a good game.  I am displeased at best by this game, it runs terribly on a GTX980 with a lot of frame dips. After doing some research I found that it is poorly optimised for most newer systems. So if you have a 980, 970, 780, 770 you will not be able to run this game as smoothly as you should.   I am very disappointed by this game, it is a good game but the players are the most unlikeable ♥♥♥ holes you will ever encounter. Most players kill other players just because they are unable to defend themselves. I can only imagine those trigger happy players and anti-social sociopath with little empathy and respect for others work and effort. I do not blame the developer for the players, but I blame him (the developer) for the poor optimization.   To summarise; This game runs poorly on $1895 PC's The players are malevolent vindictive bullies with no respect for others Its overpriced and over rated. It makes my blood boil with rage.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO GET ANNOYED BY ARROGANT SOCIO PATHS. Update The performance issues have been resolved, but the comunty is still ♥♥♥♥♥ed!\n",
      "Update: Some features were fixed, however I would still wait for full release.Way too expensive, for how glitchy it is...I would recomment buying it when its out of alpha.The Co-op mode does not allow you to save, so once you leave all of your hard work is gone.Ladders and ropes that you climb are  also involved in a lot of delicate ♥♥♥♥ery if you want to use them without killing yourself. The game needs more polish, and I would not buy it untill either the beta or its full release.Update: Some features were fixed, however I would still wait for full release.I tried to play coop on 20/03/2016, as of that date your are STILL unable to load save files, as such if you want to play with a friend you need to start from scratch every time.\n",
      "An under-the-radar game. Alien Swarm is a F2P co-op top down shooter and guess what? There are ZERO micro-transactions and it's also made using the Source engine so it runs really well. You can play with 4 classes but there are 8 characters all with different stats. There are plenty of difficulty options and that gives the game quite some replayability, you can turn friendly fire on, you can increase the number of aliens and there are plenty more options. You should definitely give this game a try with 3 other friends.\n",
      "TSW is a great game that deviates from the standard mmorpg guidelines. It's well worth checking out and I highly recommend it, particularly when it's on sale. I found the game very enjoyable, but a little on the harder end on the difficulty spectrum. For that reason, I played through the game with a friend, which added a lot to the gaming experience.\n",

      "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a game in which you choose one of two \"sides\" or \"teams\" - Terrorists or Counter Terrorists - and attempt to kill the opposite team in as many humiliating ways as possible, while screaming that every person on the other team is hacking and shooting at your own team with a NEGEV in the warmup round.You can use the AWP , or noob gun, to shoot the others in the head, and being able to scream at them when you get a double kill.You can use the Auto-Sniper, or noob gun, to shoot the others in the head, and being able to scream at them when you get a double kill.You can use your knife to stab people in the back and screaming at them when you get a kill after many hours of practicing against botsBest noob friendly game of all time10/10\n",
      "This game is extremely unique, and considering there is no other game like it, it's amazingly well fleshed out. The game consists of 3 classes, the gunner, the pilot, and the engineer. They have 3 fairly obvious and simple jobs, so by yourself it can be boring. I bought the 4-pack and gave it to my friends, and it has provided plenty of fun with all the communication with things like \"fire the portside rockets\" and \"the U.S.S ♥♥♥♥boy is at 270 degrees\".\n",
      "If you are a fan of tycoon games, this is a must!Pros: - Console development- Great development team who updates the game regularly- Good sense of replayability - Ability to branch out into many different aspects of the video game industry- The many rooms such as marketing, customer support, quality assurance, research, motion capturing, + more, immerces you into feeling like you're running an actual games company- It is more friendly and easy to beautify your company- the game is easy to pick up and well worth the money - You can find yourself playing way more than intended- You can train employees in the skills that matter to their job- You can make MMOs and addons- You can patch your game after release as well as develop updatesIt's safe to say there are many positives, it is well worth a purchase and the development team deserve a thumbs up, there are many more aspects of the game I have not listed. It seems that the little features that you notice go a long way. Final review: The game is worth the money, and cannot be compared to game dev tycoon as Mad Games Tycoon is something unique in itself that allows you to branch into many different aspects of the gaming industry. Conclusion - WORTH BUYING\n",

There is nothing more fun when you pull down your mask and spray down a jewelry store! 10/10 recomend to anyone who wants fast paced good graphics and a hell of a lot of fun! Also isnt very demanding according to my friends so I would buy at once! MUST HAVE!\n",

      "when i first got this game i thought i would get to have fun with my friends but then they started playing LOL. so i was left by my self.when my friends came back they where suprised to see i had skins and they said i was spending a lot of money what they did not rember it had bin two month since the last time i spoke to them about the game.when i got to play with them one did not whant to play with me so he killed him self with a nade.i don't play the game to much any more but i did have a lot of fun then and a little now.\n",
      "I purchased this game when it was in its very early development because I saw that it would turn into a briliant game... my only concern is that people are waiting on a multi player, I fave nine friends who said they WILL buy this game, as soon as multi-player is added.\n",

      "Guns of Icarus is very tactical and teamwork based. It's very difficult to win without it.Servers are usually okay, only sometimes laggy if your connection isn't too great. I would recommend checking server locations before giving this a go in case it is unplayeably laggy.Matchmaking takes quite a long time. Good practice with patience. When you get into a game it is worth it.Team balancing can sometimes be terrible with a very skilled team on one side and near newbies on the other.Best played with friends because I think you could imagine what chaos ensues if the people aboard a flying dinghy had no coordination.I would like to see grapples or zipwires in the game so we can board other people's ships and start whacking their balloon out of the sky.\n",
      "I did not play the first Sanctum. Sanctum 2 is my first Sanctum game.This game is really fun in co-op with friends. Communication is not entirely necessary but it definitely improves your teamwork, survivability and end result. When the core is getting attacked and you can't handle it, call a friend.The reload mechanics are really powerful. When one weapon runs out of ammo, just swap to the other one. When you swap back to the first weapon you will find that it has already been reloaded without having to wait for the reload animation. I found this very handy in sustaining damage output on the large bugs. If you have explosive rounds, you can use those to push the NPC's and your teammates around. I have mostly been on the receiving end of this...\n",
      "Lie and cheat your way to victory.Firstly, I would like to clear up some of the misconceptions about the game at launch. Many of the reviews were negative because (and I totally agree) it was REALLY buggy and there were very few servers available. A few days after the release of HIT the developers came up with a patch which fixed many gameplay issues I experienced when I first played it. Kudos to the devs for patching some menu and in game lag issues. The lack of servers will be less of an issue as more players join. You cannot expect a free to play game which was just released to have dedicated servers.As it is, the game has an attractive retro aesthetic. There are 4 classes of characters to choose from when you are in the lobby - each character with his/her own active and passive abilities. One rogue agent is selected by the game at random at the beginning of each round and each player is shown whether they are a good agent (operative) or the bad agent (rogue). The rogue is able to convert one operative into a rogue and together they must stop the operatives from completing the three missions.The lever mission is cleverly implemented. It promotes teamwork, communication between players and reverse psychology.As of now, there is only one map with the objectives spawning at random locations throughout the house.This game is best played with at least 2 other friends. There is no in game communication (yet?) so a third party voice chat client is recommended. Server making and joining is simple but I would like to see password protection on lobbies later on as the game gains popularity.\n",
      "A generall fun game to play with friends.But terribly optimized.\n",
      "This game is a great and fun experience to play especially with some friends when you dont say who or what you are.Some of the pros can be things like replayability, good people, balanced gameplay. But you probably read all of this before. I have to give the cons. Jesus Christ.Alot of people in this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who call you a nig_ger or f_uck off and they ♥♥♥♥ed your mom lol XDDDD! People leaving is also a problem. Dont like your role? Fine but come on at least try. (Framer is understandable) Finally I have to say that the game is amazing! But... The community is cancer, still try it.\n",
      "I cannot say much right now due to the game not even being in versions 1, and because of that there are only 4 gamemodes right now.   They are:-Mini Golf (Very fun, I didn't think I would enjoy the mini gold as much as it is strangely addicting)-Ball Race (Definitely a challenge but fun if done correctly)-Planet Panic (UFO Cats VS Dogs trying to retrieve as many 'animal pods' as possible to their base)-Virus ♥ (VERY fun to play especially with friends, though the crashing will occur especially on virus, and when it does it      is very annoying) On top of those gamemodes there is condo making which I am really getting into. Something about playing mini games based on skill and knowledge that rewards me with ingame currency that I can spend on making a nice home is oddly satisfying.Right now the player population isn't that big but from the people that I have spoken to they have been very nice and accepting of every player.So if you can get by the crashes, the fact that there might not be a certain gamemode with lots of people on it, the game only have 4 gamemodes and having a somewhat small population, why don't you come join us at the tower and support this game.I can assure you that the game blossum with your support.\n",

      "Tree of Savior is what you expect. A true successor of the so called Ragnarok Online. For this review, I'll be writing on paragraphs divided by pros and cons. I played through ICBT, so I can tell a lot from my point of view.Pros:ToS has a huge amount of options for classes. Large variety of classes and combinations that will most likely suit what kind of class you want best. The adventure is long and grindy, but it's always enjoyable, especially with friends, as you wander around a world masterpiece. The game is very deep too, the level cap is more than 200. The mechanics are mostly Keyboard / Controller based; hitting the enemies are manual. Positioning and tactics matter a lot. Attacks deal in an AoE. It's a step up from Ragnarok's combat mechanics mostly. If you want to go back to the ol' times of MMORPG, ToS is for you.Cons:The biggest problem I have with ToS at the current state is poor optimization. It's said that even the high-end users find the performance to be worse than it should be. For low-end users, crashes are very common due to instability. Everyone should have a stable 60 FPS for high-end PC, and 30 FPS for low-end PC.Also, the story is linear although more variety. You either start from Klaipeda or Orsha, but both are linear in nature.If you don't want to grind, no, this game is not for you.Verdict:7/10. As long as the optimization issue is not fixed, I cannot give this game a high score just yet. I really hope they will fix this up in the near future. It's worth giving a try either way, though :)\n",

      "There is absolutely no other words I can say about this game it is just magnificent. Fallout: New Vegas is based in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. You take control of the character known as the Courier, who is hired by a delivery service to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas Strip but is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly local robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, you become caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants. Fallout: New Vegas's combat is centered around the \"Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System\" feature, or \"V.A.T.S.\", which is from Fallout 3 with the addition of several new V.A.T.S.-specific attacks. Fallout: New Vegas now allows you to have firearm modifications such as mounted telescopic sights, rate of fire modifiers and increased magazine size. Crafting also plays a role in weaponry, with the ability to make ammunition such as hand-loaded rounds.A plant-harvesting system similar to that of The Elder Scrolls series allows you to use plants to create special meals, poisons, and medicines. Fallout: New Vegas reintroduces the reputation system that was absent in Fallout 3. The degree of faction loyalty influences your reputation with that faction, which affects the behavior of the faction's non-player characters (NPCs) towards you and reflects the impact of selected choices in the world. Karma is also a factor and is independent of faction reputation. Overall I give Fallout: New Vegas a score of 10/10 the story and gameplay are just absolutely outstanding it is definitely a huge step up from the previous Fallout games as it is able to feature loads of new content while still retaining features from the previous FO games. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just absolutely outstanding in everyway. I am absolutely 100% sure that Fallout: New Vegas will not disappoint you in anyway!.\n",
      "PAYDAY The Heist is just fantastic. The game focus on four robbers Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are \"set for life\", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment. This is the game before PAYDAY 2 and if you have not played PAYDAY 2 this game will be completely new to you. Although PAYDAY The Heist does not have a proper story the main objective of the game is to perform heists either by yourself on single player or you can invite your friends to join you in co-op mode. The co-op mode in PAYDAY is fantastic it works very well as they have same maps just this time you're not alone but with friends. You and your friends will have to complete a number of objectives while also holding of the police while the drill does its job and once the vault is open you can escape with the money. The gameplay is fantastic being like a GTA just without the openworld and in a first person view. Overall I give this game a score of 10/10 both the singleplayer and co-op mode are very fun. So if you're looking to get a PAYDAY game I really really recommend you get this one as it is a very enjoyable game and I am absolutely one hundred percent sure it will not disappoint you at all!.\n",
      "Far Cry 3 is an open world, action-adventure first-person shooter video game set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants. Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter, which also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system. Far Cry 3 gives you the ability to take cover behind objects to break enemies' lines of sight and to peek around and over cover and blindfire. You are also able to perform silent takedowns by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind. Equipment is controlled by a simple system. As missions are completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted by Jason, using the pelts of various animals that are found around the island. As the outposts of Vaas' pirate group are attacked and retaken, the vicinity around the outpost becomes safer, it unlocks new side quests for that area, involving missions like hunting the many different wildlife species on the island to upgrade ones equipment. Skills are collected by gaining experience from completing missions and killing enemies, and are unlocked in three skill trees, which correspond to the Spider, the Heron, and the Shark. Each skill tree upgrades different aspects of Jason's abilities, with the Spider upgrading his stealth takedowns and hunting skills, Shark for assault takedowns and health, with the Heron upgrading Jason's long-range takedowns and mobility. As skills are collected, the tattoo on Jason's forearm grows which is made up of several different tribal designs resembling the three animal skill trees. With all the new features that Ubisoft has added to Far Cry 3 I really think that this is definitely a huge improvement to the previous Far Cry games. The story is very interesting and fun, the island you explore is very big and beautifully detailed and there is so many things you can do when your bored, for example there are loads of side-missions and hunting contracts scattered around the island. Overall Far Cry 3 absolutely deserves a score of 10/10 it is just truly fantastic, I'm definitely 100% sure that Far Cry 3 will not disappoint you in anyway!.\n",
      "This is a brilliant game for these 3 reasons:Firstly, You can make friends, this game is a team game and if you play publicly you can make good friends and teams. The competetive matchmaking systim will also be fun and enjoyable.Secondly, You can make money, of course there are people who play this game for a living, but people like me and you can make money from the skins systim. Then by selling them you can even buy games from this money!Thirdly, you can run this game on almost any console or gaming divice you can think of. this game looks acceptable and has decent graphics.Purchesing this game is money well spent. If you want a goof fps; csgo is a good option.\n",

      "Well, where do I begin with you, Rust. You are one of the best games I have played in the last few months, Rust is honestly one of the most fun survival games on the market.You spawn somewhere random on the map, with a rock, torch and a couple of bandages... Completely naked. This game is soooo much more fun with a friend as you can make a big house like I did. Although it has it's many bugs it is still easily worth the $20. This is what you buy into:-Naked men-Houses-Guns-Wolves-AND MUCH MORE!So, what are you waiting for? Get this game right now.10/10\n",
      "Firstly before I get any hate, I KNOW this game is in early access. But, the game so far is very laggy. Loot barely spawns, and when you do find something decent you will probably be shot by another player in one of the taller buildings or you will be killed by the TELEPORTING nethers. I honestly wanted this game to be good, the concept is cool, the monsters are scary but the developers didn't quite pull it off. What you are paying into is:-A pay-to-win style game-A lagfest-Scenery that looks like it was made by a five year-oldAt the moment I can't recommend this game. It is fun to play with a friend for a couple of hours, but it gets very boring after a while. Save up another $5-$10 and buy a game which is more stable and fun like DayZ or Rust.3/10\n",

      "Fantastic game, its a shame it's not in the popular \"too play\" list of alot of people. It is a very fun game and relatively balanced races makes for fun multiplayer with friends. Single player however does get boring very fast a must play game with friends or online. Would strongly recommend if you enjoy games like SC1/2!\n",
      "A great game so far! Really fun to play with friends. The cartoon graphics bring a very nostalgic feel to the whole game, the idea of a tower defense game with a mix of \"fps\" style to it is great! I would recommend this game if youre looking for a fun game to play with mates, a great coop game! My main criticism is it does lack complexity particularly with your talent tree, I would love to see an introduction of a more complex talent tree and a bit more varitey with tower upgrades / spells. However this game is still awesome and has alot of potential, can't wait to see where they take this game!\n",
      "Edited review, great game having alot of  fun however getting a few random crashes probably just release jitters nothing to be worried about.. the only issue i have is the combat system very much just mouse spam without a huge amount of varitey.

      "You can play Ten-Pin Bowling10/10This is a great game. In fact, one of the best survival sandboxes I have ever played. Even though it is in beta, it has a massive amount of content, and it is fequently updated, so there is never a dull moment. With the amount of opportunities available to the player, the possibilities are limitless. I personally, have had almost too much fun playing this amazing game.Also, I didn't mention the friendly and humorous team of developers that have created this wonderful gaming experience.I hope this review has helped you make the decision on whether to buy this game or not. I'm just hoping that you do buy it, and have tremendous amounts of fun playing it.\n",
      "So let me start off by saying I got this in a bundle and thought \"Why the hell not? It could be fun right?\". Skip forward about six months, got 1.5 hours of gameplay and my friend asked me if he should get it for some multiplayer action. My response was \"Why dont we go jump in a pit of fire and burn to death, it would be just as fun\". But seriously I didn't enjoy this and here is my list of pros and consPros-Large expansive maps with lots of people which could be fun-The graphics can be nice if you don't look at the textures to closelyCons-Game starts you off with a very poorly done tutorial that can teleport you every place you don't need to be. I had to noclip to escape some of places I was thrown into-The tutorial is also confusing and frustrating if it decides to work-Even after the tutorial I still had hope maybe the rest of the gameplay was differenand less glitchy and sometimes confusing, the game was littered with latency issues as well as the forementioned issues that appeared in the tutorial-Also to me the gameplay felt like it was just trying to board the success of other modern FPS'All in all this game was a disappointing which is saying something cause I went in with 0 expectation. It felt unfinished and like a rip-off of an already overdone concept.\n",
      "This competitive racing game simulates the rise and fall of friendships as  person after person is hit by the grappling hook and thrown into last place. Best game I have played in a long time and many tears have been shed. 10/10\n",
      "This game is definitely in my top 10 without a doubt i found myself comiing back to this game alot great game if just want to play with your friends and can get competitive at sometimes,the building in this game is awesome reminds me of a minecraft call of duty game gret game\n",
      "A very fun game good co-op game for friends, will keep you entertained for hours i havent played very much because im busy but i look forward to when i do\n",
      "Whilst at first I intentionally held off from purchasing this game (as many of my friends did not have it and the fact that its prior incarnation decided to wipe itself of save files several times) I decided to take the plunge into Borderlands 2 when two other friends decided to purchase it during a steam sale. Since then there has been no regret to buying this product, the graphics have greatly improved, the gameplay is tighter and faster paced and the humour is nearly original Portal level in my opinion with lots of clever quips and references that you have to really see and search for.There is one thing however that must be though of when purchasing this, make sure you have a friend to play it with because as with any game that requires a bit of grinding a friend goes a long way to seperating boredom from adventures into hilarity.A geniunely good game if you do not mind the occasional What the Heck!!!! moments from enemies.\n",
      "I recommend this game as it is a fun experience and better yet when played with friends.  I also recommend the DLCs as they inhance the experience further\n",
      "I highly reccomend this ! I have played this game countless times on my consoles and finally decided to buy it on steam. Although admittedly I am a tad disappointed in how short it is but that doesn't stop me from loving it to bits, multiplayer is dead last time I checked but hey, you can stalk your prey by running through vents with the shadows being your best friend and hunting down mercenaries using epic weapons and stealthy cloaking.Oh yeah and you can be a human too if you want.\n",
      "Reccomended, but a fair warning. If you want to become serious about being a competitive player then be ready to pour your life and soul into this game, and encounter people who think they can play it 100 times better than you. If you can work through this, and find a capable group of friends who you enjoy playing with, I envy you.\n",

      "This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.\n",

      "Definitely recommend for versus...but don't get the low violence version (get a friend from overseas to Gift you a copy so you) get uncut.  Also the game is getting a bit old now...really need Left 4 Dead 3 (and preferably removal of all those nasty DLR mods which have turned the game into a ridiculous parody hybrid of Left 4 Dead and Super Mario.\n",
      "the game is brilliant, when your leaving your little shelter that you whacked together you have to always be on the lookout for other players and/or dangerous animals, then you get shot from somewere when somone is trying to blame you for something and holding you up....' give me everything you have now!'.......you give him nearly everything in your inventory.....*BANG BANG*....shoots you anyway, thats why you have to be careful about other players... you can never know who to trust but if you can play with friends or make a alliece with someone you can be better off with tradeing resourses or defending your area. you always have to be upgradeing your base and/or area.... banits in numbers from 1-15 ( depends on how big your base/town is) will rush in and try to raid the place and take all the resourses and trash the base, defently on big servers. a firearm is very good for defence/ attacking but everyone will learn that if you only have one gun.... dont go walking around with it because if you die.... youve lost your defence and you cant be respected by other people with a firearm, then theres the KOS players that dont care if you literly just sapwned in the game, they will shoot you for the pleasure. and there the ultra friendly people you get you started with some food and a tool when you join the game. In all rust is a very good game, if you like games like minecraft, DayZ, 7 days to die, all those crafting and survival games, Rust is defently the game for you, it is awesome, anywere from 20 players vs 20 player wars ,from building a local town and a anti-bandit force, its great. then you have the 'lone rangers', who work completly by themselves and dont go near other people, its still fun but its much better with friends or in game alliences....end result- AWSOME GAME, worth the money you pay for it, AND ITS STILL IN ALPHA!!, once this game it complete it will be so good.- ZeuXFi\n",

      "This is not an analysis, I dedicate this great game to my best friend David, who died years ago due to cancer. he was the first who taught me the world of Doom. And that after he passed away I wanted to show that wonderful shooter and many more to my best friends A. and L. Now I feel that someone changed my life and I wanted to change, in the same way, the lives of the people most I care. If you were alive I know I'll love to see how this great game reminds me of the pixels and Windows 95, pirated dvd and evenings, playing with my classroom partner after university (whose birthday is this next week and I think, now, he is the happiest man on earth). Thank you for existing. Both friends, rest in peace. It's DOOM!Esto no es un análisis, dedico este gran juego a mi mejor amigo David, quién falleció años atrás víctima del cáncer. él fue el primero quién me enseñó el mundo de Doom. Y que luego de su marcha quise mostrarle ese maravilloso shooter y muchos más a mis mejores amigos A. y L. Ahora siento que alguien me cambió la vida y que quise cambiar, de la misma forma, la vida de las personas que más me importaban. Si estuvieses en vida yo sé que amarás ver cuánto este gran juego  me recuerda los píxeles y Windows 95, los dvd piratas y las tardes, después de la universidad, jugando con mi compañero de salón (cuyo cumpleaños es esta próxima semana y creo que, ahora, es el hombre más feliz sobre la tierra).

      "TL;DR = GRAV is a great game buy it now!ReviewGRAV is a randomly generated world sandbox game. It is very addicting and is fun to play whit all your friends! You can build huge constructions by day and battle monsters by night. I know for a fact that the developers are caring people due to their involvement with a community that I am apart of.Upsides+Very addictive gameplay.+Fun to play with friends.+A variety of different enemy and NPC types.+The game has a good sense of humor.+Dancing!Downsides-When I first ran the game I thought I was running the game on a potato not a $1,000 computer.-Requires some settings adjustment before it runs without lag.-Ran into multiple collision errors (Trees)-If you jump onto a rock next to an ocean the rock likes to throw you in. (Falling into the ocean will kill you.)-No way to change key bindings.Overall Early Access Score = 8/10\n",

      "This game makes me twitchy with the creepy atmosphere, it gets your blood pumping seeing the killer off in the distance and when you hear the heartbeat. This game has succeeded in creating a great 4v1 cooperative horror game. There are however a few issues which is mostly due to the people playing the game.First of all, campers at hooks, maybe the developers could make it such that the rate at which the entity kills you is slowed when the killer is around.Secondly, some games can be laggy due to the host's internet connection or sometimes, your own.Thirdly, at the moment you can't queue with friends as survivors however it has been said that that will be implemented soon.Fourth, deranking due to people disconnectingLastly, there are some bugs which weren't present in the beta that have appeared likely due to the new maps and killers.With all this said the game is worth it when you have friends to play it with as there is a private match mode so you can have fun hearing your friends scream and beg for mercy. Do note the game is skill based and you have to think how the survivors think when you're the killer and vice versa\n",
      "It really isn't all that free to play and sure you can get the same stuff by both farming and buying with real life money.However if you just cash for the right weapon you just wreck everything.Even for making things such as decorations for your clan you may require items that you might as well cash for.The game also forces you to buy weapon slots with your real life money so this game is pretty much p2w.However if you're willing to pump your money into it then sure it is fun get some friends,make a clan,cooperate and have fun\n",
      "Its fun,wacky(that's gunna get old) and tries to make playing MMORPGs more fun I recommend it to those who like the idea of MMORPGs and isn't so serious as this game tries to have the 2Fs(funny and fun) so its exremely light-hearted.It also has diversity in terms of classes and is perfect if you get some friends filling the different roles and playing together or just do whatever you want and have fun!\n",

      "I would really LOVE to play this game. The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle.But there some downsides in which i should mention...1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT.2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are ♥♥♥♥, like. Very Very ♥♥♥♥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem.3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are ♥♥♥♥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL.4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, ♥♥♥♥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No...5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be ♥♥♥♥ed fixing.Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for.i'd say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.\n",
      "I never really heard of it and boy i should have.my friends reccomended it when we were looking for a co-operative shooter to play.My god, i love this game.Heres the scenario: You've been stranded on a zombie-infested island and your goal is to survive, pretty simple at first until you relize everything is very limited. Your first gun might have 2 bullets in the clip. This makes finding melee weapons like axes or sledgehammers very lucky. The community varies, once your with a group of friendly people and the next thing your surrounded by bandits and taken hostage.This game looked really simple on the outside but when you play a rough hour of it you will start to notice how immersive the game can feel.There will also be scenarios where you have to make a hard decision. The game does not script that, this will happen in any way possible, will you go to the town and look for supplies? will you abbandonn your friend to the zombies and make an escape? will you eat the moldy corn and risk infection?The choice is yours and it can and will impact on what happens after.However, the game does have some downsides, which might not be a big problemThe shadows and details can sometimes screw my pc around, esspecialy if you have skype on.Sometimes the game can break by not spawning items properly, like once the only things i could find in a town is moldy corn and clips. I restarted the game and everything was fine, there were clothes, notes, bows, and everything else you might find in a post-apocalyptic town.The respawn time does not exsist in this game, once you die you can quickly sprint back into the game and hope for something different to happen.Out of all games i had not found such a zombie survival like this one aside from DayZ of course9.5/10\n",
      "Game needs more discounts/lower price to entice gamers to try this fantastic game, which has been around for quite some years now.Has a fantastic community that is limited in numbers.Come on trackmania guys, throw me some decent discounts and ill buy/gift to a bunch of friends.Overall 8.5/10, would recommend to anyone, of any age, and runs on even the slowest of gaming PC's.\n",

      "If you've played Europa Universalis and co, then this game is awesome. Enough said - buy it and dive in. If you've never played a Paradox game of this nature before then read on....This game has a steep learning curve, matched only by the joy from the gameplay after you get over the initial hump. My brother showed me the interface and took me through some of the concepts of the game initially which got me over that learning curve. I would recommend watching some kind of Youtube videos or reading up on the game concepts because it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the terminology of the era.There's a moment when it just starts to click and when it does, it feels like you've opened a door to a whole new world of great gaming. I have spent more time playing this game than any other.I would recommend buying some of the expansion packs for flavour as the big ones have some excellent additions to the Crusader Kings gameplay however to start with, the normal game is great. I have always been a fan of the Total War series. This game is not that. It's not as hands on tactical (regarding battles and such), it's much more strategic in it's approach. It's much more personable. Your character, his or her family, friends, relations, vassals and enemies really MATTER.I have always been a fan of the Civ series. This game is not that. It's a much more in depth dive into the feudal system. Civilisation is a brilliant glimpse at the whole of human history. This is the PHD on the middle ages.If you're into strategy games, you deserve to play this and don't be put off by the initial learning barrier. Because when you're succeeding at this game, there's no feeling like it.\n",

      "Bound By Flame – ReviewBy GMCamulosGenre: RPGPlatform: PC, PS4, PS3, 360Publisher: Focus Home InteractiveDeveloper: SpidersWhen creating a game what do I want to add? A nice dash of action, some good graphics, great sound in both music/ambient and voice acting, a nice control system, a hint of swearing, a little somethin’ somethin’ for the guys, and conversely nice looking guys for the ladies out there, some good story elements, nice character progression and levelling and a metric tonne of other small little things that fill in the gaps between the aforementioned.Now, can Bound By Flame find the right mix or has the ever omnipotent game master added a dash too much of one ingredient and not another?Gameplay:Bound By Flame was an interesting one pre-release. It looked like it had something really kicking for it. A nice combat style, a demon possessed player character (true we have seen a lot of those in the past), and hey, it was next-gen.What we got from it was a fun solid (in areas) next-gen RPG. The story for Bound By Flame is that your character is a member of a mercenary force called the Freeborn Blades that are trying to protect the world from the Icelords who slowly taking over and killing anything they come across. The Red Scribes who hired the mercs to protect them while they find an ancient temple and try to perform a ritual to help out… can we see where this is going?The ritual obviously has to go wrong cause is the start of the game and all, and your character is left with a very nice and friendly demon residing in him… I mean let’s see, how bad could that actually be right?The demon will eventually try to get you to make the choices which suit IT best, which can lead to a very interesting storyline as your companions will treat you differently if they think you are turning evil. So should you embrace the evil and grow an awesome set of horns and look like you are constantly warming up people three towns away, or will you keep your humanity and make choices that help rather than hinder?Well if you go evil you will find that the demon can be a nice kick into the powerful meter, but the choice is yours.It’s just a pity that its strongest feature is a nice combat and skill system. The three skill trees are Ranger, Warrior and Pyromancer.I dare say you only spec into one of the Ranger or Warrior classes depending on how you want to play but some of the Pyro skills are very complimenting, such as the ability to have a nice fire shield or even ignite your weapon for more damage.A quick warning before moving on, the game did kind of shock me the first time I met an elf and my whole opinion of how they can converse was tipped upside down. The occasional swear in a game is fine, but when half the cast will try to slip one in every third sentence, it drags away from it being a fantasy game and just tries to tip into a game for less mature players.And don’t get me started on the fact that one of your more… well-endowed female companions looks like she could be shivering just looking at a fridge given what she is wearing… I still don’t understand the need to make a female character in a game have less protection than a male character… breastplates on guys… yet a breastplate on a girl will cup the breasts and show them off… I just don’t get it…And given that there is crafting in the game I kind of wish there was more I could craft, though the recycle feature to get some materials back is a very handy touch to let you experiment with what you want to make and use/upgrade.Graphics:The game is next gen, so I would have liked to have seen a little more… pezaz? Don’t get me wrong, it’s still solid and I can’t really fault it, but it’s still just at a level that says… yeah, we know we are making things for next gen, but we need it to work on everything else at the same time.Nice little touches pop up here and there, such as the changes your character goes through the more you let your demonic inner voice take over… but its things we have seen before in other games.Sound:The sound is good, if we don’t talk about the lacking performance on the majority of companions. There is something to be said about your demon side and his influence and conversational chats, but the majority of the team seem to let me down. A nice casual chat while a player dies, no inflection of pain or regret, just “Yep I am dying…” ok, yeah, thanks… I mean, don’t say that, it’s not your time… bit more work could have gone into this side of the game, and I don’t just say that because I know a lot of voice actors who could use work *wink wink*Skill Levels and Controls:Bound By Flames combat never really had me at a point where I felt UBER as I quite often get to in other RPG’s. The game really does ease you into how the combat and levelling works at a nice solid pace in the first section, and just keeps going from there. On normal it still felt like the monsters of the world were levelling at the same time I was, it’s just that I was able to put points into my skill tree’s that continually allowed me to stay ahead of the curve. Some fights still gave me a bit of a headache, but still, nothing you can’t overcome.Your choice of companions can also help with battle and thus can complement or just strengthen your play style, bit of a choice there to help out as well.Replayability:With the amount of choices in the game, and deciding what you want to do, the game has a little replayability unless you want to see what it’s like to swap from allowing the demon to take over, or to be the man in charge all the way through. But it’s an RPG, when you know the story, you know the story. Nothing major is going to change from playing through it again. Last thoughts:I did enjoy Bound By Flame, it’s a great little RPG which does have a lot of merits. I do kind of wish the game was longer and had a bit more variety, but hey, on the whole I did enjoy it and had a lot of fun playing through it all the same.I give it 7 Demonic Possessions out of 10.\n",

      "Awesome to play with friends!\n",
      "This game used to be epic, not anymore, infact not for a long time now. Too many little kids and F2P players acting like jerks and swearing over the mic or in the chat box!! I play video games to meet new friends and have fun and this game is not fun anymore! Nothing seems to be done about the poor behaviour either as it's has gotten progressivley worse over the last few months especially on official MVM servers. Making this game F2P has killed it, sorry, killed it for me. If they make an update where the premium players don't have to deal with the F2P riff raff and make age restricted servers I'll come back, if not sorry Valve you have lost a customer. It's not worth the stress and anger and urge anyone who considers playing this game to be wary of the disgusting behaviours by players or avoid this game for a bit. I know Valve will sort this out eventually as they are a great company. Please Make TF2 and enjoyable experience again.\n",
      "Incredibly fun game, with fun characters and even better with friends. This game could really work on a massive multiplayer scale.\n",
      "Great little indie game! Beautiful artwork some neet little puzzles only negative is moving your little bug friend around can be a bit awkward and some of the puzzles might entail some random clicking untill you figure out what you're ment to do, but at 96% off it's well worth the pickup, mint!\n",
      "Fun. Replayable. Worth it.You may think you need to know more than that, but you don't really.There's plenty of tracks, they're well made, they're both challenging AND fun, there's plenty to achieve & find, and you will keep coming back to it time after time. Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.It's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer.\n",
      "Bearzerkers is a terrific game where the developers have nailed the art of game design.

Pros: Game play is intuitive, making it easy to jump straight in and start playing. Great variety with 6 unique visually appealing levels“Gauntlet” mode for a whole extra degree of challenge Awesome soundtrack that really enhances the feel of the different levelsGreat “kid friendly” funCons:  Where did my afternoon just go……\n",

Should you let someone through the border because a friend asked you to? All of these questions run through your head with evey new person you meet, and all the while, your family back in your apartment are starving, freezing and suffering from sickness... And every major choice you make, the world around you changes, as the daily newspaper will let you know.. So by admitting one too many smugglers, that drug-selling boom you read about while eating breakfast was entirely your fault. Oops!\n",
      "i've been playing this game since the pre steam dayswith each version it gets even betterthis really is the definitive half life modeclassic mode alligns it with the normal game (still co-op)if you don't choose classic mode it brings elements from opposing force (the x race and two more weapon slots)what other mod can you co-op the half life 1 collection with friendsand play as boris from goldeneyeor a giant mushroom?\n",
      "I'm a big fan of this game. I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy game that is relaxing. This game has the standard chose your own upgrades xp system which keeps it interesting.It can feel a bit slow at times, but there's always upgrades to be found and I don't think I have come close to maxing out the speed yet.The game offers a borderlands style mp where friends can join your game.\n",
      "SOOOOOO MUCH FUN! but its 7x Funner (Its a word now) with friends i also recomend buying a hand ful of dlc too for even more play time\n",
      "This is a great game but the problem is matchmaking, you may go up against a party of players in unranked and you will lose. Unless you have friends in a party in unranked games you wont enjoy yourself that much. Finding ranked games is semi hard but at least you dont have to play against a party of players, you can play in solo matchmaking games in ranked\n",
      "A heap of fun so far! needs to be played with friends and the griefing is high, but a heap of fun!\n",
      "Great game to play with a new friend or even a stranger you just met the other day.. would co op with a random again.Warning though: Some parts of the game may cause sever uncontrollable anger management issues hehe lol.. be prepared to rage.. lol\n",
      "Really fun dinosaur shooting fps, the characters say funny **** when they shoot dinos XD, definitely worth buying and playing with friends.\n",
      "pree sweet i guess fun with friends.\n",
      "A lot of people are saying guns are underpowered, i have been instantly killing triceratopses with 1 bow shot to the heart, they aren't underpowered, you just ened to take in the fact that you need a good shot.PROS-Simulation of where the organs in dinosaurs are seems real-Guns seem very nice-The Camps are really good and useful with finding guns and equipment-Game is really enjoyable, if you dislike it just play with friends and hunt t-rexs, will make the game more funCONS-Sometimes if you are lying down and a t-rex comes to you it stands there until you kill it or disconnect and re connect-Game is a bit buggy (it's in EA to be expected)-Not enough diversity with dinos and guns (it's in EA to be expected)\n",
      "It's like a hybrid of Diablo II, Warcraft III and Borderlands. Play it with friends or online to get the most out of it. There's a great community, everyone I've ever met in a game has been super nice and helpful. One of the most underrated hack & slash games out there, possibly due to marketing at the time of release.\n",
      "More Borderlands goodness from Gearbox. Fairly similar to the first in terms of gameplay, with some expected tweaks and upgrades. Storyline feels a bit more cohesive for BL2 vs BL1. Gaige and Kreig are fun for regular players to try something completely different in terms of their playing styles, but may be fustrating for people new to the game.Perfect for when you want to do a quick 1 or 2 hours gaming session with friends, dropping in and out of each others game is fairly fluid and straight forward.\n",
      "10/10 would get friendly fired again\n",
      "amazing game,very diverse and interesting.lots and lots of weapons to choose from and use make it VERY entertaining to adventure with friends.\n",

      "God this ♥♥♥♥ is awful. A big disgrace to Metal Slug fans. I doubt you will have too many problems playing singleplayer. But this as multiplayer is BROKEN!! It is out of sync with the other players, framerate issues, audio problems. Save yourself the money, even if it is a discount, and if a friend offers to buy it for you, save him money and say no.\n",
      "A great game thats free. Very fun to play with friends\n",
      "tl:drScore: 7/10Pros:- smooth and colourful- easy to learn but challenging to master- cheap- still being improved- quick matches make sit easy to fit in schedulesCons:- lacks content still- will start to get repetitive- no real reason to play rankedSpeed runners is an indie developed, 2D sidescrolling, racing game that is fit for all ages due to its unique appearance, availability and 'quick to pick-up' controls. This combined with its fast paced gameplay and short game length allows it to be played anywhere and anytime (i myself am guilty of sneaking it in and about while doing homework and assignments,\"just 1 more match!\") which can explain its overwhelmingly positive feedback even while it is still in 'Beta' development. Included with this gameplay is the intergration of the ranking system which involves the use of the leaderboard which tracks players in you league and how many points they have which allows the player to check their standings compared to others which allows for a competitive environment that increase the games longegevity and also seperates casual players to more serious ones.Speed runners appearance is fit for all ages due to its bright and bold colour palette which distinguishes the background from the runners that the players control, giving the game a 'quirky' and fun feeling. Its availability comes from its low price of 10 dollars while not on sale and 2 dollars while on sale which is a cheap price compared to most other games in the market that usually range from 15 to 25 dollars. Speed runners is also a 'quick to pick-up' game letting players get into the game faster and also making it less daunting for newer players to the genre. This combined with its cheap price and colourful appearance sets this game up for long-term success due to its wide target market and the fact that cartoons are better than realism long-term due to realism always being outdated while cartoons itself are a unique and personalize genre of presentation.Its rank system involves the use of leagues which are different groups that players are placed in due to their skill. Its uses a point system which is the way you rank up to a higher league in Speed Runners in which points are earned according to you succes in matches. However you may ask how they balance out the points lost or gained if you in a match with higher ranked people? Speed Runners makes it so that if your vsing a higher ranked person, the points you lose in the match are decreased and if you vsing a lower rank person, the points you lose are increased. This, combined with the quick matches that speed runners offer makes the ranking environment, friendly and less daunting for any player. There are the reasons why Speed Runners in my opinion is worthy of a 7/10 rating which can be improved through increased content, different styles of gameplay e.g. new gamemodes, perhaps a unique character customisation (might be going a bit too far xD) and general bug fixes which i strongly believe will be achieved when this game is out on full release (maybe not the character customization).\n",

      "Awesome game with friends. Playing with random people generally sucks until you play several missions with them and break the ice. But it's definitely worth buying while its on sale!\n",

      "This game had 0 problems for me,  ran it straight away and it has pretty quick loading times. I dont know why people would spam this with negative reviews. Just do research on the requirements before you purchase a game .... the negative reviews are from duds with ancient pc's who dont do research before they buy....  and theres always  that refund option so why not give it a test?gameplay is great, graphics are on point and it stays true to a total war game but with a fresh twist. Co op and multiplayer work nicely so grab a friend and try it out! I recommend this to anyone into RTS and that have an average or decent PC,  youll have a great time.  my specs : graphics - geforce gtx 750 tiCpu - Intel core i7 920@2.67Ram - 8 gigs DDR3HDD - 2 TOS - Windows  7 ^ pretty old but it does the job \n",
      "Planetside 2 is something to play with friends. Fight as brothers or die as a hero, there is something for everyone and always a role to fill. It's free to play so grab afew buddies and drop into the action as a solo squad or join a large battalion for some chaotic action.\n",
      "Very intresting game. Deafinitely not for everyone, a couple of my friends bought the game tried it once and didn't enjoy the different action pace. This game will be very slow and mellow for 60% of the time then in the matter of moments you will be faced with many descisions that might lead life or death.\"the real draw of DayZ is a combination of the risk of losing everything, or potentially coming out on top and winning everything\" - Brian Hicks, DayZ Producer.\n",
      "I love Killing Floor, and have spent many hours playing it. The game may not be a perfect but it is thoroughly enjoyable. The idea of having a live action short video related to the game is great, and while the \"found footage\" concept is cliched, I had no problem with using that device in this context. Unfortunately beyond that, it is forgettable. Even in a short video, something far more interesting, audacious, novel or even creepy could have been achieved. I was rather disappointed. While it wasn't terrible, I won't be recommending the video to my friends. The game, however, I'm still keen to recruit people to play with me!\n",
      "Wow, almost too much like real life! Very short game. Excellent price (free!). Nevermind virtual reality, augmented reality, physics modelling, immersive gameplay, real world simulations, time travel... This is the real deal! Feels exactly like having a friend. Perfect for when you don't actually have any real friends to talk to. You can have, and lose, virtual friends, and have realistic awkward conversations, where important things are unsaid and you second-guess yourself, and try to read other people's minds, while projecting your feelings onto them. For an incredibly simple game it's almost horrific torture to replay  the experience of an uncomfortable long-distance friendship while simultaneously navigating the complexities of early adulthood.\n",
      "If you have a couple of friends who like co-op games, then Payday 2 might be the game for you! Bank Robbery Simulator 2014 is full of varied heists, weapons and awesome looking masks. You'll zip-tie hostages, yell guards into submission, cut down waves of incredibly under-trained SWAT soldiers and make a load of cash while you're at it. You can choose to complete heists using stealth, using silenced weapons and signal jammers to finish the mission. Or you can go guns-blazing, equipping flak jackets and assault rifles to bring down hundreds of your foes. Some of the DLC packs are also well worth it, and silently pulling off a particularly difficult heist with your friends is immensely satisfying. This game is well worth the few dollars it costs, and you'll have countless hours of fun while playing. Take note that the single-player is no where NEAR the quality and standard of co-op, and poor teammate AI will seriously bring you down.As long as you have friends to play with, I can almost be certain that you will love this game.Bring on Payday 3!\n",
      "This game changed my life.No longer can I look at a horse - real or virtual - without thinking \"Gee, I wish I could brush your hair in Secret of the Magic Crystals! It fills me with sadness when I realise that I will never be able to play training games involving tapping the arrow keys in time with the horse's movements with any of these other equines, care for them when they're sick, craft horseshoes from a variety of different metal types, create potions to improve their abilities, or send them to races and quests. And worst of all, they will never know the sheer joy I experience when I find any of the magic crystals scattered across the land.'Secret of the magic crystals' provides you with countless hours of entertainment and uncontrollable joy, however that will be replaced with deepest sadness once you realise you can't live these wonderful adventures in real life.10/10 would buy again, for me and all of my friends\n",
      "Great game to play with friends, with many ways to go about playing it. Go in Guns blazing? Or get in and out without the cops even knowing you were there? it all depends on your team and skill, but even the smallest mistake such as not answering a guards pager can mess your plan up entirely. With a vast range of weapons, customizable masks, Body  armours and gear, this game is definitely worth trying if you enjoy intense gun fights and smash and grab scenarios.\n",
      "This game is FREAKING incredible You have to play it (t=your friend is an orange fairy for goodness sakes)\n",
      "This game is  so fun with friends learning how to play can be so simply this game is evenly matched to league of legends their pretty much the same concept level up your hero and destroy the main heart of the base expect all heroes are unlocked on dota 2 but in lol you have to pay to buy new heroes and skins something that might make people go crazy but i think dota 2 should be as much the same popular aspects and i just love it when i get a high kill streak making me feel like a god and winning matches with friend i recommed this game for steam users and enjoy! 9/10\n",
      "This game has great potenial the campaign is quite good  online invasion with friends it fun but some of the weapons are simply hard to use some weapons just feel's the same your secondary does no damage whats so ever even to kill a robot on low health  you cannot do. Even though this game was released in 2013 i expected more from sega i rather play jak and daxter on the ps2 i still have more fun buy this game for lols or just with friends. 3/10\n",
      "This game is so fun with friends as you run around with a lightsaber in your hand and the force in yourself.\n",
      "I haven't been this invested in an MMO before. It's just perfect in every way, and I really love that you can unlock all jobs/classes on one single character. Love love love Final Fantasy lore and how they've put their own unqiue spin on the genre. There's also a friendly feeling to the game, allowing new players into the genre to be hand-held every step of the way :)\n",
      "The fantastic thing about Ultimate Chicken Horse is that you don't even have to be good at it in order for it to be hilarious fun. If you have even one friend to play with in local multiplayer (I can only recommend local multiplayer since that's been my only experience so far with the game) and you can both laugh at your own absurd (and no-doubt plentiful) virtual demises, then this is a game you owe it to yourself to at least try (don't forget - you can refund any game for any reason if you've owned it for under 2 weeks and played under 2 hours!).I already feel that I've had my money's worth from this game, and those I've played with fully agree. My fellow players and I have discussed the game and we agree heartily on its quality.Ultimate Chicken Horse...is accessible to gamers of most skill levels (some basic platforming experience helps).is thoroughly amusing, light-hearted and fun (or, hey, you could play it seriously, hold a tournament! It's very flexible!)plays smoothly.employs simple controls.is quick to learn.features some surprising depth and creativity in combining objects and game mechanics (the 'honey,' especially in combination with moving objects, is my favourite part of the game).has an enjoyable and fitting soundtrack.contains only a few minor issues which only occasionally detract from the experience.has a cute style of animation and cute voices for all the playable animals.features a simple, well-paced progression system, with the important parts (new levels and characters) unlocking early, and the fun little bits (clothes/accessories) unlocking later.uses a clear-cut and simple scoring system that requires little explanation, if any, as most of it can be understood simply by learning through play.can be enjoyable even for less-experienced players - if you're not hung up on the goal of winning and just like having fun, it doesn't matter if you don't often come out on top! Watching others yelp and holler as they navigate a devious stage is half the fun.is thoroughly spectator-friendly.should probably be in your Steam library by now.\n",
      "Only played a few hours, partly solo, partly with my brother and a friend. Already got my money's worth. I imagine it will be quite some time before another game captures the spirit of giant-robot-battles-in-space anime as well as this one has.\n",
      "excellent game. Easy to get intohours of fun especially if you have a friend playingrecommend , been searching for a easy game for a while now\n",
      "I have been playing this game from the begining before it entered steam. But I have switched into other games for a year. 3 weeks ago, i downloaded robocraft again and feeling so awesome with the new guns and items. But after this ******* loot update, hell yeah. Hell yeah i can build a castle with those 100000000+ bricks and blocks from the loots! And welcome to the railcraft. How awesome it is in the world of railgun.  Thank you developer, I am deleting this game with my friends together.\n",
      "Finally, a shooter where the focus isn't being an un-stoppable killing machine, shelling everybody with democracy for Merica'! Spec Ops investigates what the darker side of war is, such as the underlying intergrity of orders and duty in a mission, decsions made by soldiers towards the execution of a \"success\", and the psychological toll of killing and navigating a war zone. As for the gameplay, the third person mechanics work very well and the combat is very dynamic thanks to an interactive envrionment and exceptional friendly and hostlile AI. What's unique to Spec Ops is it's rich narrative (including the dark themes explored) and the fact that it's a shooter that isn't designed to mow down waves of enemies, drive cars through helicopters and surviving skyscraper collapes...  Gets a 9/10!\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful, exciting game. Great fun to play with a group of friends, although be aware that it *could* destroy your friendship. And you might also find out that your girlfriend actually isn't as smart as you thought she was. But hey - it is all in good fun! If you like any sort of co-op multiplayer game, this is a must have in your library!\n",
      "Fun game to play with or without friends\n",
      "Lost what I thought was my best friend to it. All he does now is csgo and it made me do so too. I've been suffering mentally and physically now and I always wished we never played this game. tl;dr the game's addicting, it made me lose someone I loved and made me lose myself. It's your choice to play but never forget there is more to this beautiful world than CSGO.\n",
      "Fun with friends, but boring on its own. Shooting zomibes after awhile gets boring. 6/10 :)\n",
      "True classic. Fight against the zombie horde in an effort to survive with your friends!! My only criticism is that this (as well as the Legend of Zelda and Mario) is a complete ripoff of Halo. Good game.\n",
      "Its a great game to have fun with your friends it cartoons shooting eachother Its MAYHAM\n",
      "It's certainly a great parody of the plethora of other simulation games that are everywhere on steam, and Goat Simulator delivers as a fun, quick game to muck around in. It's only a very short game, and will only really provide a few hours of fun at most, but the price tag is representative of this fact. Great game to let a friend play and screw around in, this game delivers in being different, funny and absolutely ridiculous at times.\n",
      "Oh man, great indie for only $2 WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Seriously though , there's a tower defence game mode and a versus mode that's really fun but what you really want this for is the multiplayer. Heck get it with a friend and you're only paying $1.60 each. That's two potato cakes or a really good game your choice really.\n",
      "Being friendzoned by a chatbot have never made me feel so miserable in life.10/10 will hurt my feelings again.\n",
      "That moment when you play the game like 30 times! it so fun then i get pranked and my friend deletes the game so i have to install it again 10/10 so worth it\n",
      "So addictive, great for LAN battles, real time strategy that incorporates 4X strategy game elements (RT4X) and ho boy is it good. You take over planets and star systems over other races while constantly panicking about how much there is to focus on when your fighting in numerous places in the galaxy and trying to build your economy (my economy is always bad), #managemuch?Make sure you have lots of hours to spare and that you play this game with friends too. Strongly recommend you give this a try if you like strategy games and you are a sci-fi pleb like myself, as I have absoutely loved and fangirled over this game.Personal Best Strat Gam: 9/10\n",
      "Team Fortress 2. A huge step from Team Fortress 1. Team Fortress 2 is a great game to play with you friends. Steam trading make its great, if your willing to give or sell a item to a friend or someone you meet, for something you would like. Team Fortress is a highy-addicting game. Its many maps, as well as community maps, weapons makes it one of a kind game. With none stop fun. Now Free To Play. Anyone can play. Great Game 9.5/10\n",
      "You could probably say that this is the worlds greatest sandbox game and a rather simple one. Play on your own, Play with friends or just hang around in a lobby.\n",
      "what are you doing with your life?the ending basically sums up, go get a real girlfriend, and don't waste your time on dating simlators haha\n",
      "This game is fine and dandy... IF YOU PLAY WITH FRIENDS.This game is unforgiving and pretty boring if you go at it solo. Either get some friends together and give it a whirl, or wait for it to come out of alpha and see how it develops then. :)\n",
      "Fun game, though it gets somewhat limited in replayability. It's best played with friends/clan, where you can form larger team and work together.\n",
      "Decent game, becomes a little bit monotonous, however, I suspect it becomes more exciting further into the game than I have played. Good co-op action, though I would've liked perhaps teamwork to be more of a requirement rather than a \"everyone charge at the enemies and spam attack buttons\". However, it has nice visuals, smooth gameplay and enjoyable multiplayer. Good if you need a quick multiplayer game to play with friends.\n",
      "Absolutely FANTASTIC zombie survival, especially for a free download. The only problem I've found is that you need a strong ping in order for it to be playable, a somewhat ordinary ping seems to make the zombies are bit weird. Would reccommend, tonnes of fun with friends, low system requirements and it's free so everyone can play! (Good for LAN parties)\n",
      "Ok I'll give it to you straight, This is a very short game around, one weekend you can finish the campaign! But this really is not a factor in this RTS, This game represents how good RTS games can be by providing you some of the best multiplayer ever seen with you having MOBA fights or massive land battles with you and a friend. The Graphics are far more superior than DOW one and has much better strategy but BEWARE, If you want a 1000 v 1000 battle your dreaming. I am speaking harshly about this game, but only because its so good to play and deserves to be in every one's steam View list as a Favourite or Favorite, if your American. One of the best RTS games is here! Although this is a bit dear, you get what you pay for. $40. May the Ork blood be forever on your chainsaw!\n",
      "Good to play along with friends (: and it's a really pretty looking game.\n",
      "The Darkness released early February 2012 and was a game that didn’t receive much advertising or player generated hype. The Darkness 2 follows the story Jackie Estacado a mob boss who inherits a peculiar ability which is wielding the Darkness. The game uses cell shading similar to borderlands which compliments the game world well. The gameplay is quite original and lets you “quad-wield” which basically means you can wield a gun in each hand while also controlling your two darkness demon arms. The controls feel a bit fiddly when using a mouse and keyboard, if you own a controller I would recommend using that instead. This game has some of the most gruesome kills I have ever seen in a game. Using your demonic arms you can rip your enemies in half, slice of their head or even pull out an enemy’s spine from his butt the list goes on. The single player campaign took me about 6 hours on my first play through and left me wanting more, not because the game was bad but because it was so darn good. There is also a co-op campaign which was fun to play with friends but got boring very quickly. In summary, I really enjoyed this game and its unique gameplay but found it was bit to short.\n",
      "The original Borderlands was amazing but its main selling point was how fun it was with friends and Borderlands 2 is no different. If you played the original you will feel at home with Borderlands 2, except everything has been improved. More varied quests and locations, new classes and NPCs, improved graphics and best of all new GUNS!!! If you didn’t enjoy the original Borderlands then I can’t really recommend this game for you because the game hasn’t changed enough to draw in those who didn’t like the first, however those who missed the bandwagon in 2009 should jump on now with a three friends and appreciate this magnificent game. The only gripe I had with the game was that when playing single player the game can slow down and you can get bored quite fast. So in simple terms, if you have a enjoy cooperative shooters this game is for you, lone wolves won’t enjoy this quite as much but it is still a ride worth taking if only just to experience the beauty of Pandora.\n",
      "This game saved my long distance rekationship and continues to be regularly plastered across my social networks to the annoyance of friends.  If you are kinda interested just play it.  I loved it so much I've bought at least three times to get my friends on board as well.  Its easy to do when its $3 on sale and you get two copies to give away if you buy it as a gift ;)Building your own contraptions is wonderful ludicrous fun, and the community mods and developer updates mean there is always something new to do.  This is a labor of love from an experienced developer and it shows.The three main modes are puzle (solve a puzzle), contraption (press play and see what others made), and create (where I make my musical animal themed death traps).  The community is great and always building something new thats cool so there's something for every one!The game has also been modded to heck by others if you want to get mega creative within the engine.10/10 would play Angry Birds with cats again.\n",
      "The game is good fun. Whether you play alone or with friends. The massive scale battles are just as they are advertised and the gameplay is great fun. Some people might say that the graphics are bad but to be honest I don't really see anything wrong with the game's graphics.\n",
      "This game, despite what all the fuss is about it surely an ideal game for fun. It won't blow you away but it does become addicive. Playing with friends is a must and makes this game better, overall a good prices. Don't expect anything that will blow your mind though\n",
      "Omg this game is fun haha. I like the mechanic where instead of saving yourself you have to fill yourself to win :) I reccomend this game to you guys and your friends\n",
      "This is a great military simulator, much like ArmA2 but completely improved graphics, dialogue etc. The campaign is pretty long and there is also enough scenarios to keep you busy for a good 30+ hours solo, but after that there the multiplayer which is 100% more fun with friends. Overall, great military simulator.. but it is a SIMULATOR, this isn't Call of Duty fellas, yes there is bang bang in every mission, but it it a simulator (cannot stress enough)! If you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all CoD style and run and gun everything with 2 legs (save that for multiplayer). Appart from that, I had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come!\n",
      "Great, fun and creative game with friends!\n",
      "I spawned in 10 minutes later found 3 friends i died was really sad...spawned in again 30 minutes later found 4 friends 1 died shortly after from a arrow to the head we all cried... so then we left 15 mins after that we found a town decided to call a airdrop than the airdrop landed and people started swamming around it enougher member died in the middle of that chaoes so we ran away and got really sad and cried then offed our selves the end.\n",
      "This game, I loved it ever since I strived to get ArmA II and play it. It was emersive, beautiful. Yet, had it's downside. It doesn't limit you to be one or two things, it lets you be whatever you want. Want to travel with friends and help others? Everyone will be grateful and love you.

      "[Insert instructions unclear joke here]I don't have a controller so I had to check the control settings for the keyboard and being a silly goof, I kept pressing Enter to select the keyboard settings but nothing happened so I kept pressing other buttons. After some mild frustration and acceptance of my defeat, I sought the almighty and all-knowing sage, Google, for help and found this controls cheat sheet by the developer https://steamcommunity.com/app/289760/discussions/0/540739319701009463/ I know I'm not the only one who had this problem.. or am I?But apart from my personal struggles, it is a fun game to play with friends (jk I have no friends) or by yourself against AI. It has good music and just the right amount of neon that won't make you gouge your eyeballs out. It would be nice if they added a cursor for easier navigation on the menu though for dimwits like me.Is that a rocket in your pocket?\n",
      "Great game on so many levels.1. The roleplaying benefits are excellent.2. Survival aspect of the game is by far the best.3. First preference of Survival Roleplaying game for playing with friends.\n",
      "For those who love RO2 this game is a must-buy. Plenty of customisation, tactical based team gameplay, explosions and stuff, and a thriving and friendly community.\n",
      "just do it in one sitting with a friend\n",
      "I first encountered this game 5 or 6 years ago when a friend gave it to me on a flash drive.  It was hours and hours of fun, and I am truly glad to see it on the Steam store.  I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a quick bit of fun, any roguelike enthusiasts, and any strategy gamers out there.  It has a simple framework, but allows for a significant amount of complex, strategic gameplay.Give this game a try!  You won't be dissapointed.\n",
      "The whole game is fantastic, but nothing compares to when you find a few guitars and with sme friends play music.\n",
      "How to make DayZ better1. Please for the love of god let us spawn with friends on the coast. There is nothing more annoying than spending an hour looking for your firends. Absolutely ridiculous.2. Optimisation of the game is terrrible, 80 fps in the country which dips to 25 in cities? What the hell? 3. Combat with zombies sucks ♥♥♥. Using a melee weapon, the shots dont ffel like they connect at all, when as a zombie game that is one of the most important things. 4. No random events to keep you going, there should be hordes of zombies roaming around. 5. LET US SPAWN WITH FRIENDS RUNNING AROUND FOR AN HOUR LOOKING FOR THEM IS NOT FUN\n",
      "This is the ♥♥♥♥! nothing says ♥♥♥♥ you nature like killing  the greatest sea preditor.  the furthure the distance from, the better the score. totally worth the money if you have friends, i founod myself sharing the game around.\n",
      "This game is challenging, fun and rewarding. However it is not a friendly game to newbies\n",
      "Addictive shooter, enjoy playing multi-player with your friends on custom servers and missions. Endless fun.\n",
      "Shrimplicious... I'm sorry my little friends\n",
      "Nether is like DayZ, in the sense of survival and trust. Only trust the people you know, such as friends or family. In Nether you fight to survive an apocolypse in witch demons have taken over. What you do is find components and food. Components for guns and food to survive. You don't create guns yourself, you get the parts and go find someone who can create them, but the guns you can create are fun. In of the sample pictures at the top of the page, you will see someone holding a can with a handle and a mark saying bullet here. This is, wierdly enough, a shotgun! A shotgun, made from a fly spray can. The things in the game are pretty basic but I hope that they add new things. Note to the creators, add in a crafting section for players to create things. I wanna create my own god damn fly spray can shotty!\n",
      "Love dungeon Crawlers? Then this is the game for you. Fight your freinds and defeat the boss. Thats it. Its quite simple but brilliant. This game is a good representation on how to fight your friends and win. This game can tear your friendship apart though. So beware of that. XD Anyway get this game. Its sale price is $10 buts its worth $100. Its so awesome and amazing! BUY IT!!!\n",
      "Ok, this game had a good premice. Shoot zombies, monsters and robots with friends. That was a good idea. But its not a good idea if people from anywhere other than where they set up try to play. Im Australian and every single time I shot an enemy it would register and do damage. When I roll away from the Attacks, I would still get hit. This game is bad if you arent near their servers. And I don't like that. I will retract this review, as soon as Australian servers come in to this game. Until then, its a bad game for me.\n",
      "Ok, so to start off, I have not played a lot at the time of my writing this. But I have played enough to make a review, and my overall review for this game is BUY IT! This game is awesome, it may not be the prettiest and there are still a few bugs to work out but if you want a game that can scare the crap outta you, play this.Now for my experience, I started the game and everything seemed normal enough, I picked up everything, set up some cameras and explored the map. At some point I thought \"Lets go to the night portion... biggest mistake ever! I start up the night and look through my cameras (Im not stupid enough to walk outside during night in a horror game!) and I notice that the cameras have a motion sensor. So I stupidly choose one of the lit up buttons, and witness the RAKE, not only break my camera, but also SCREAM IN MY EAR! I was so scared my heart missed a beat or two. After that I tried to scare the crap out of my friend by making him wear the headphones while I search to find the RAKE. I couldnt find him on the cameras so I head outside to hunt him. After five minutes I see the RAKE in the middle of the path and attack, missing him completely and making him run away. I try to follow but couldnt catch up, so I decide to set up a camera and run back to base. At this point my friend is hearing the RAKE running behind us and think not to tell me incase I look back. He shoulve told me, becauise I turn back and soil myself along with him to the RAKE hitting me, screaming and running away. Overall Rating: 10/10 buy this game for a good horror fun time\n",
      "Firstly, I have experienced Deepworld for much much longer than it was on steam.Admittedly, the Steam version is a bit shoddy. That's because the game was originally on Mac and iOS and is currently in the process of being ported to Windows. (I usually play on V2 Mac.) But if you check the updates, the V3 Steam version is slowly but constantly getting better, catching up to its v2 counterpart. Additionally, some of the microtransactions mentioned in negative reviews are on the way out. There's no more skill cap and now everyone gets unrestricted access to all biomes.Anyway, I should tell a bit about what Deepworld is.Deepworld is an online multiplayer sandbox game. A notable aspect is the fact that every single server/world is linked together via world teleporters. This makes it easy to travel between worlds, to go mining, exploring, questing, building, and so on. You can build something cool and show it to your friends or the public, or you can visit other people's creations. There's a place for everything.The sandbox aspect means you can build whatever you can think of. Building materials are easy to aquire.Remember: Deepworld is always in development. It will improve over time as more content is added to the game.\n",
      "Fun & addicting ! Played this with a couple of friends to double the fun ! Can't wait for the future updates and improvements\n",
      "What can I say? It's an awesome game and have a nice price. I and my friends have a lot of fun playing this. Superb game!! It would be way better if it gots workshop!\n",
      "Its one of my favourite all time games and favourite MMO of all time. The superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack & slash system is amazing for an MMO. Its simply, yet can be sophisticated too. If you learn all the powers and fighting combos, you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces. A lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand, no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you. This is one of very very few games, where 99% of everything in the game, appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 24/7. The only downfalls to the game IMHO, is the leveling cap. Level 30 is very low in my opinion and since I have played since launch, I would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now. Thus adding much more content and storyline to the game. The DLCs are ok and some of it was just what I was hoping for, but are money grabbing DLCs in other peoples opinions. But when you love this game as much as I do, I dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life. Ive already maxed out and done everything possible in DCUO on the PSN network and have recently migrated over to the PC version to start again. It shows just how much I love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developers.The powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst PvE and PvP would be great too. Im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well. For that to happen, the F2P system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a P2W game. It is somewhat but minimal. Yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill the community. I would love to work aside the SOE developers to offer suggestions, test new content and help expand the DCUO game overall. From day one, I have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like WOW. To me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so. But now its too late for that, but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best MMOs out there. The metacritic score of 72/100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 85-90. But I believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years, had hindered its progress and made the community much smaller than it should have been. If good content and level cap raised happened earlier on, the game would would have been much more known and better ranked. Its direct rival, Marvel, has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game, but I still believe what DCUO offers is still is just as good, if not better. I have had ideas in my mind about DCUO and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players. I have emailed the SOE about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears and/or the team has given up on DCUO or but it on thr back burner, because they believe the potential the game had, is long gone. When it first became F2P, it pulled in 100K new accounts. SOE should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing DCUO really is and what theyve been missing out on. But sadly, I believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future DLC projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account. Thats where I think SOE went most wrong. Instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the F2P system they implemented, they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases. To finish up on my review for now, I still think DCUO is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves MMOs, hack & slash type of games, RPGs, DC Universe and a mostly friendly community base. The game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect. But IMHO, this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes. The majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment I get. I have a ton of suggestions, ideas and concepts that could/would make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary, but whether someone from SOE reaches out or even cares enough about its own game, to do so, I will only have to wait and see. I have contacted them twice already in recent times, with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email, so I assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered. I hope DCUO will continue to expand and SOE looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when DCUO was at its peak, but since then, there has been nothing but mediocre DLC packs. Good or poor as they may be, we need more! I would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline  to DCUO. It would be amazing to see and I could gurantee, it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content. As it is right now, the latest content added, are very small and lazy-like. Not much hype or even amazment about them. Seems like a small team is only left to deal with DCUO and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart. I had wished and still do, for DCUO to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added. All the possible storylines are already there in the DC Comics and just needs to be integrated into DCUO. I dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true DC fans and DCUO fans. Ill give SOE a free idea/suggestion on a possible future expansion to further DCUO and its content and gameplay. Take the DCUO universe to the universe....literally....Brainiac came to us...lets now take the battle to him and his home. Giving the opportuinty to even explore the Green Lanterns galaxy, the remains of the planet Krypton....there is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone. Enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die DC fans and DCUO fans. If this were somehow to materialize, I would further support DCUO and SOE and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion. And if given the opportuniy, even help out with testing, suggestions or anything I can be of help with if SOE were to approach and ask me to help. I would be a great ambassador for DCUO. My love for the game, knows no bounds and I just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending. Please SOE,  heed my word and suggestions, and do whats best for us DCUO fans. I will forever be grateful and dont want to see DCUO end up a dead community where I am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base. Its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans. But Im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring DCUO back to life again to the peaks of MMO history and amazement that its destined to be. It should be rivaling WOW. WOW has no real rival and I thought DCUO had that potential with its already rich history of lore and stories that are already out there. How amazing would it be to play it with your own created hero ?!?! 9.7/10 - Almost Perfect\n",
      "once in a while a game comes around that is truly beautiful. when my dumb friend bought this for me, i honestly thought it would be terrible..............oh how i was wrong. the game has one of the most heart wrenching and meaningful stories in any game i have played and adds humour to help from the intensity of its story. its twists and turns will have you crying tears of joy, and sadness, and youll want to keep playing more 9.5/10(puzzles could have varied)\n",

      "<BEFORE REVIEW NOTICE> Played about 100-200 hours on the browser before the steam release and am only just now getting round to this review because i havent quite been bothered enough<BEGIN REVIEW :P> Positive: This game is great. If only i could end it like that but there is so much more to say. The game itself is like if insurgency and battlefield had a child which decided to become free. (No mum, this is my ART!). To begin with the community is great, at least in Australia/Oceania. I've only encounted a few toxic squeakers and have made it my person mission to eliminate them repeatedly.The guns are really fluid and I like the semi-realistic take the developers have taken on. With most rifles and smg's requiring 2-3 bullets to kill.The maps are fun to play and encourage teamwork and make for some great moments with or without friends. New guns every month or so. Negative: Optional buy-in credits of some sort. Really quite optional, as mentioned before pretty much every gun does 2-3 bullet kills. (Snipers obviously less)Sometimes struggle to actually get into the game, keeps saying \"installing plug-in, please wait\" for about 10 minutes but as mentioned before, once you get into the game you can easily forgive it.Well thats pretty much it. Hope this helped you make a decision. In the end though, its free, its fun and a good time waster 5/7 would spend 20 minutes writing a review for again.\n",
      "Very fun especially with friends. Can be a bit boring without. Other than that like minecraft but with tons of mods and round objects. Not that thats a bad thing of course. Space engineers is a minecraft-like building sim but in my opinion.  A hell of a lot more fun. Would recommend to all people who like space. (Tip: turn your mouse sensitivity all the way up when piloting ships)\n",
      "Really fun to play with friends\n",
      "I love this game, however without friends playing with you, it can be very slow. I got stuck last time I played because all my quests needed me to get steel and I can't find any.\n",
      "So fun and funny! Still in DEV But its fun to play with friends.Need to add maps, I understand its in beta but maybe at more maps (Only 2 atm Autobahn if fav map)Rating 8.9/10\n",
      "im not gunna lie, im a bit addicted to this game xDI recommend this to anyone and everyone, it's really fun to play with you friends and people online.I really enjoy the rankings, gives people something to aim for (instead of just aimlessly playing over the same maps over and over, however i'd be fine with that ;3 ) It's great how you give players the opportunity to create levels and have the chance to be featured for others to play.I would suggest maaaayybeee creating a couple more official maps? Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers. overall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!\n",
      "Contrary to what people are saying, what you're wearing DOES change on your screen, for starters as Xian when you're looking down with the default costume, you can see her high heels, when you jump like this, you see her torn dress, with the survivor outfit it's changed to boots, shorts, and there's also a knife strapped to her leg, not sure about upper body though and no clue what any of the other characters look like but yeah. Honestly, for $2 it's not that bad, I mean come on, they're cool outfits and if you're playing with friends they get to see it too. Don't buy it if you're not that into things that only have a visual effect and no gameplay effect, but if you're fine with something that's just visual, get it.\n",
      "Interesting game !!! Fun to play ! But hopefully you should be able to find your friends easier.\n",
      "This game is great! If you have time :/ Lots of Pay2Win which allows high end guns at the start of the game. If your not into games were you need to grind it isn't for you but if you want to have fun with friends it is greatBy far the best World War II game on steam and its free :D\n",
      "great game, loats of fun to play with your friends.\n",
      "Have you ever wanted to rob a bank? Then this is the game for you. You can play it single player, but honestly way better if you play with a group of friends.\n",
      "Guns of Icarus was a very enjoyable experience for my friends and I. The only problem I have with this game currently is the lag. Living in Australia, the Oceana and Asia servers are quite laggy.

      "So im sitting here on a lazy sunday night, and my friends are encouraging me to download this game. i know literally nothing about this game, except it is similar to castle crashers, apparently. i kinda can't be bothered downloading this, but peer pressure really sucks. so im gonna get this game, and i'll get back to you guys some time soon with the proper review of the game.\n",

      "Warframe. A third-person sci-fi shooter with RPG elements, that at a glance would resemble Mass Effect. Pros:+ Great variety of guns and 'classes'  + Fast-paced combat+ Decent modification options+ Colourful graphics+ Nice clan system (which I have yet to experience since I don't have any friends)+ Free to play. All microtransactions (save the cosmetics) can be unlocked sooner or later. If there is anything enticing about the game, it's the 'classes' which are referred to as warframes. Different warframes have different stats and skillsets that caters for specific types of gameplay. The guns themselves, though there are not s*** loads of them, are complemented by a weapons system that allows for a great deal of experimentation and theory-crafting, especially when combined with an impressive number of modifications. The Dojo or clan system allows even more access to guns and mods. The gameplay itself is extremely simple; shoot enemies when you see them (aiming for the head if you're a CS veteran), and take cover when you're a bit low, using your primary, secondary, melee or ability anywhere in between. Movement and gun physics are refined and not a great deal of skill is required to scrap some AI metal.Does the game come with microtransactions? Yes. Is it pay-to-win? No. *Thank goodness?* Save for cosmetics, any game altering gun, class or modification can be unlocked at some stage of the game. You won't need to spend a penny, but lots and lots of time. Which leads to:Cons:- Grinding for mods / weapons / 'classes'- Missions feel repetititve after a while- Lack of story / weak contextThe cons though are more than enough to put someone off. We've seen it many times before in F2P and many people are looking for a game that breaks through this cliché. But to compensate for the fact that any mini purchasable item can be unlocked, players are required to grind ( a bit hard ) to unlock the parts they desire. In terms of missions, I could probably list all the game types using my fingers (*edited there are 14 mission types, some with alternate modes etc.) and this does become repetitive after you've played the game for a while. The game lacks a storyline; and whatever attempt is made to seem like there can be totally ignored, and the lore itself is lacklustre. But how is Warframe then still fun to play? One word. FRIENDS. We may not have any, but it is MORE THAN RECOMMENDED to have a friend or more playing this game with you. It exponentially enhances the experience both in terms of gameplay and content. There's a reason why this game is tagged under co-op. \n",
      "Been playing this title for about 9 years. It started off as a simple 7MB mod, which is still one of the most played LAN games. Dota has one of the steepest learning curves in any game, but this A-RTS will provide countless hours of fun, especially when you're playing with friends.\n",

      "When I picked up this game on promotion , I didnt know what to expect , I have heard review of it , but let me tell you .This video game actually made me concerned for the characters. I didnt want to see how many ways laura could die , I wanted to save her friends so badly, so much so that I had to remind myself that time wont affect the outcome of the game and I could go off venturing into the tombs and raiding it.Its an adventure game , and in that sense if accomplishes exactly that. I felt empty after the game was over. It took me on a heck of an unforgettable adventure , despite it being \"generic\" or not . I felt attached and but sad that i completed it only over 4.5 hours with 75% completion and all tombs raided.What I really hope for the sequel is that laura isint an invincible badass , just a badass. Even though she does superhuman things ingame , I really she will be human and she will continue caring for others.\n",

HOLY CRAP A SPIDER!! oh wait just some dust nevermind that back to the game. The game is great the zombie spawn rate isnt too high but no too low, It runs smoothly (depending your internet and computer) ive got a laptop that WASNT made for gaming and it runs smoothly but i do have to turn the graphics low for its best gameplay. I hope you want to get this game because it deserves it. BATTLE ROYALE// battle royale is of course based off battle royale and its good it puts a twist on BR with zombies and not as many guns :) havent played a round of it yet but i'm sure me and you will like it alot. Remember DayZ mod? this is like it except more crafting less zombies less guns but more possibilities of wich some you can take >:)Hero/GoodGuy: This role you will help others but will take action if other player is not friendly, You will give others spare food low graded weapons (because they will possibly turn on you if too op) water and maybe even some crafting supplies.Bandit/BadGuy: You kill any player that sets foot in your sight, You either work in a Bandit group or alone you live off others supplies and only scavange for supplies that can kill! You will never help anyone in need you will torture your victim in any way possible and you may even kill them you may just let them bleed out like a torture mechanism. Neutral/Citizen: You scavange for supplies and try to avoid people in fear of them being a Bandit. You dont kill anyone unless self defence, if you do encounter someone and they see you, you try to talk but you are catious of that little chance of them killing you. You will always be that one guy who has hardly any loot. But Once someone gets good loot they have the choice.Hero?                                                  Or                                            Bandit?\n",
      "Great Game. I would suggest playing this with friends as it is a waiting game. Probably one of the best free to play games out there.\n",
      "If your going to get this game! MAKE SURE A FRIEND HAS IT TO it is so fun with a friend travelling the world and being scared out of your mind!\n",

      "Super fun open world destruction! Highly recommend. For those of you who love mass destruction with different kind of weapons, this game will sure not to disappoint. Furthermore, Just Cause 2 multiplayer has just been released which means you can cause more destructions with your friends and a server usually hosts around 1000 players! a big + for me :).\n",

      "I've been playing Unturned for a short period of time, but I have to say that it is looking very promising. As i've only played the free version of the game, i'm yet to see the features that are available when playing the premium version. When you first open the game, you're given the opportunity to create a character. There are a variety of customisation options available, however some of which are only unlocked with the premium version of the game. Once passed the character customisation stage, which can be edited later anyway, you can choose between a singleplayer, multiplayer and tutorial option. Being a man that likes to learn for himself, I reframed from playing the tutorial, but for the sake of reviewing Unturned, I did. The tutorial gives you a basic rundown of the controls; movement, combat and driving, simple but helpful. Then I decided to jump straight onto singleplayer. Unturned gives you two options of maps to play on; PEI, which is your basic 'post-apocalyptic' map with buildings and towns, and Arena; a difficult map, which places you in an arena like area with nothing but the forest around you. I decided to play on the PEI map first. Once spawned, i realised that you start off with nothing, and I LITERALLY mean nothing, you dont even spawn with clothes on. The spawning in Unturned is random, so I was spawned near a walled off area which i later found was a military base. I fought my way through the base and gathered a few supplies including a backpack, handgun and suppresor, and a map of the whole of PEI. While in this menu, I discovered a skills menu, which can be upgraded by earning eperience though killing zombies, and a crafting menu, which didnt make sense to me so I decided to leave it be. Judging from the map, it seemed that PEI was a large scale map, that had many places to visit, so I decided to visit the local town. Once i arrived, I was greeted by a large horde of zombies. I managed to pick off 5 of them with my handgun, but i ran out of ammo and had to run for about 5 minutes before running upstairs into a house and dying because I got stuck in the tub. This is the point where I decided I was bad at video games and also decided to play on the other ma, Arena. Once loaded, it spawned me into an arena like area. The areanwas surrounded by water ans there were tall rocks around me, vaguely resembling Stone Henge, and some supplies, however, due to the small inventory space, I could only carry a small knife and three seed which i planted soon after. I decided to venture out into the woods and I quickly got lost. My hunger and thirst bars needed tending to, so i decided to hunt some animals, and quickly realised that the pigs I was chasing were very fast, or that my player spent too much time writing a pointless review of a game that nobody will ever read, so he gained a substancial amount of weight and decided not to go outside anymore. I soon realised that the only way to satisfy these meters was to travel back to the spawn and harvest the seeds i planted earlier, but I unsucessfully did so and died trying to find which way I came from. Then I decided to try out the multiplayer secion of the game, but was unable to do so because I have no friends. Unturned is a great game, however, I do feel that playing with friends would give you a much different and better experience in contrast to playing by yourself. Unturned feels like a very basic version of DayZ, or games similar to this, and this is not a bad thing. Unturned gives you a similar experience to these games, but it expresses itself in a much different way, this is mainly bue to the blocky artstyle of the game, which much resembles games like Roblox and Minecraft. Unturned is the type of game that you could let your 7 year old brother play, without getting into trouble by your mum for letting him play a violent video game, but can still be played by the older demographic just the same. To summarise this review, I reccomed this game to anyone, however, get some friends, whip up a server and play together, and you'll have a much better experience. Do I see potential in this game? Yes I do, so long as the developers continue to work hard and listen to the community and take their ideas on boards as well as their own. Give Unturned a try, you wont be let down.\n",
      "anyone familiar with CS1.6, dust, office etc get this game. Its 1.6 but with much better graphics, user friendly, weapon skins, casual for first timers and ranked for experienced veterens and the list goes on. Great 10/10 game, no regrets\n",
      "This game is a BADASS game. It so fun playing with a group of randoms or with friends either way it's still enjoyable. The weapons are great and so are the DLC except for the Santa mask one.\n",
      "It's been almost a year now since it has been released and the game is not yet optimized. Still there are FPS lags but it can be tolerated. It's quite fun when you're playing with friends, but that's about it. What's really annoying is when you need to find another server to play and right when you join, your character resets to a fresh spawn. Zombies can walk through walls with holes smaller than them. At the moment, I would not recommend this game due to many bugs and glitches.\n",
      "Good game to play with friends\n",
      "The game is enjoyable especially when you're with friends. Trippy music and lighting. 9/10\n",
      "A-Must-Own Game! This game Is an excellent game for creative minds while fun at the same time! It also comes with multiplayer! U can Join a server with other people or play with your friends!! I definetly recommend this game :)\n",
      "great game for free building and making friends!\n",
      "its a fun game to play with friends and by yourself. recommend.\n",
      "This game is a great laugh to play with friends and other players. From living a normal life to building a new invention, garry's mod has millions of different possiblities to explore and do. Definetly worth buying!\n",
      "If you like your history and your planes then this game is the perfect game for you. With friends this game can be fun but also serious. The only problem is probly the controll system because of the mass amount of buttons to press. But apart from that i recommend you download this game considering its free!\n",
      "The Drone Kombat fps multiplayer is one of my favourite dlc as I love to make futuristic games and this dlc helps me achieve that, the really cool things about this is that the fps drone you use has rear-view mirror and a top view of the map.  You can also with up to 8 of your friends or could publish it and let others play your game. Also you can have Enemy drones that you have some combat with. Finally it comes with great building assets to make your futuristic game a great thing about that is these assets are free to use and make your game.\n",
      "Great dlc to use with agf, this can help you achieve much more in AGF, as you only could make maps or levels in it without the dlc that is still good if you want to use unity later on.but now you can make more to your game and develop a game that you and your friends can enjoy, it comes with the zombie assets in it so all you have to do is buy>build>play its really simple. This is one of the best dlc's you can get to make your zombie game with or whatever you would like to achieve with this, I would recommend this game to everyone that loves a good zombie game or a good laugh.\n",
      "This dlc allows you in seconds to play a fantasy side-scroller this is great and fun to use, you and you're friends can enjoy this amazing dlc without them buying it. first you make the game then you can use there packager tool to package your game and give it to your friends this tool is totally free, best Fantasy side-scroller tools\n",

      "A good game if you're playing multiplayer. If you don't have friends that play this, then boo-hoo.9/10\n",
      "Killing floor is a great game. I play this a lot mainly because I like to ♥♥♥♥ my pants and do it with a few of my friends. This game allows you to work together to create a team of six and defeat waves and waves of mad monsters. It is a great game and i would reccomend it to lots of my friends.\n",
      " CASTER On the surface, Caster is a generic third-person shooter with absolutely horrid graphics.Have you heard of a little phrase that goes \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\"? I know its cliche, but, Caster fits into that little phrase perfectly.Play beyond the original generic shooting and bad graphics and you'll find several fun and interesting things.To list a few:A fun and smooth movement systemInteresting and diverse enemy typesPower-up abilities AND enemies that affect the terrain of the levelA multitude of different levels, with community support for even more levelsTo be honest, I've had more fun with this game than some games that cost 10x the amount this does, mainly because of the mechanics it includes that, on paper, seem game-breaking and/or horrible but actually make the game extremely fun. For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.\n",

      "Good fun to play with friends\n",
      "Dont know why anyone would mark this game down just because it realesed a paid DLC. Its an amazing and super fun game with friends. The graphics are glorious and i myself am super excited for the new DLC even if i have to pay for it. Getting hung up on the whole early access thing is just getting in your way of enjoying a great game. Dont hate be a mate\n",
      "first experience. log on try to join server and it says \"Snapshot 16\" and it wont connect to servers. i followed some basic steps to fix this (basicly u have to run the game as it not intended) ran it in \"no sky effects\" mode and it worked fine for 2 hours. just started to play with some friendly people and enjoying the crafting system then game crashed.... TADA GAME IS NOW COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. now connection errors and wouldnt let me connect to the server no matter what i tried. not to mention the poor design of the server lists and the fact that u cant find the last server you were on so u dont lose everything. Basicly i found the game far to full of bugs and errors that the devs seem to ignore but make the game unplayable. $30 is far to steep for a game that should be sold for $10.\n",

      "Blew my mind, worth every dollar/penny/pound/euro!! One of if not the best game to come out of 2013. An approach taken that I have not seen in a video game before. Your sanity will be tested in this short but extremely fun title. If you haven't bought it, if you haven't played it, then we simply can't be friends.\n",

      "Really fun game to play with friends, as it says it is in deep alpha so dont expect no bugs or perfect optomization for your pc. Still a really good game recomend+.\n",
      "This game is absolutely incredible and I cannot wait for the future updates. There is a lot more that the developers can do such as : Extra NPCs (bears, sharks etc.)  Make the caves dangerous and something you have to prepare for. (Almost like a raid maybe?) Add extra features to the clans (better identification and base building etc.)So far I have encountered a few people and the game makes it an interesting moment every time, you must find out if they are friendly and be prepared if they are not. Even without other people this game is intense and interesting, there are so many places to explore and so many things to do.I am really looking forward to the future updates of this game.(Check out my screenshots to see some of my ingame adventures.)\n",

      "Sorry for this long review, if you dont wont to read, then all the other ine sentence reviews should convince you to get this game. this is pretty much just details on the game itself and my thoughts on them. i dont think i get really specific so if you wanna know more just go to the wiki or the play guide http://store.steampowered.com  Pros (in my opinion, obviously) Most Classic RPG experiance in an MMO that ive had in a while. its its pretty rare these days where you start off as an actual  normal adventurer and get quests from an adventurers guild. these days most mmos are just replica of \"you are a chosen one! now go fight evil\" sorta thing. The combat system is about the same as the standard good old formula, has som pretty animations for combat as well. The Gear and weapons have a nice aesthetic feeling to them and they get the look of the gear right as well, going from begginners gear to higher level gear, it actually matches what it looks like in comparison to the level. no flashy beginners gear. to bad that there is no costume slots so you can use the image of old gear, but most of them look great to begin with. A great part of the class mechanics is that once you reach lvl15 on your first class, you can choose to pick up any other class and conintue with that, of course starting from level one again. but if you dont want to do this you can always start a new character, since they give a generous amount of character slots per world (at least after the ifrst month of paid sub). The Story is quite typical of a final fantasy game, chocka block full of characters and plot. since i play most games while listening to something,  i usually dont pay much attention to what the npc's say and just follow quest obj, but this has probably been one of only 10 or so games that i dont do that. Animations, Graphics and Design of Final Fantasy 14 are quite good, if you look around you realise that every npc, wheteher they be friend or enemy, has a ton of idle animations and animations while being interacted with. for me who uses a pretty low end pc (basically what the minimum it states, maybe a bit lower) its still looks quite beautiful. The Environment and world itself is quite expansive,though it is section off into different regions. For example Thanalan (name of whole region) -> split into North, South East, e.t.c There is thankfully no game breaking pay to win gear. though there is gear that you can by with real money, its aesthetic stuff like mounts and costumes. basically all you can by with real money is -> The game itself + paid DLC ( which so far is only heavensward), the sub needed to play and aesthetic stuff like premium dyes, mounts, nostalgic costumes and little pets that will follow you around.Also if you happen to be a japanophile like me you can hav Jap audio with english sub. just saying, but theres nothing wrong with the english voice actors, they're acutally pretty good. Cons i wished that they would add more voices to the cutscenes and general talking to npcs, because so far only important mission cutscenes have voice.maybe no sub fee or a lower one, its pretty heavy on my wallet since i play alot. hahahasometimes around really big updates the launcher freaks out and does a bunch of erros and you'll end up redownloading it or searching the internet for an answer.\n",

I know it is a Telltale Games Series but in the one game that I didn't expect to cry in I cried so hard that I had express my sadness to my friend... After that I realised I made once wrong choice and I ended up playing the whole game again... Only to cry again... 22 hours in 2 days...2 hours  of that was crying into a pillow... 11/10 would cry again.\n",

      "Rust is a social experiment. Anything you craft in-game can, and probably will be raided and stolen, no matter the defenses. People will add you to their friends list for the sole purpose of knowing if you're offline or not in-game, so as to determine the perfect time to steal all your items. Rust is a soul-crushing digital manifestation of what happens when the world breaks down and guns and explosives are the only form of barter or negotiation.It is a beautiful game. The sunrises and sunsets are majestic.What it does to people. however, is the exact opposite. Rust is a more brutal, unforgiving, and relentless online arena than EvE Online - as even in EvE. you could park your assets in a neutral station and wait for the storm to pass. Here, the storm is everywhere... right outside your door, crawling on your ceiling, while you're asleep in your bed. Waking up to find your assets intact in Rust can be considered a major accompishment, and usually only practical for those in large clans which cross multiple time zones.Copy Pasta\n",
      "This is a fun game where you can muck around make fun things and play with friends. The multiplayer on this is very fun as there are a variety of gamemodes to choose from. The more popular ones being Trouble in Terorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder and those are not even a quarter of the gamemodes that are available in multplayer. You can also play with friends in a private serever but you need log me in hamachi but it is worth the free download!I recommended this to anyone.Worth the cost\n",
      "As it is still in alpha it still looks and plays like the mod. Very fun with different momments in the game but is alot more fun with friends and on a server with the right amount of ping and players. It is still in alpha and so far it stands out the most on than other survival games. Good job devs\n",
      "This Game is amazing its fun and fully action packed. You get to choose to be between a counter terrrist which are people that prevents terrorists from planting a bomb or using a hostage as bait, as terrorist is when you get to plant the bomb and try not to get the counter terrorist from defusing it or trying to get the counter terrorist away from rescuing the hostages. This game is a great way to make new friends and also experience what it is like, the graphics are unbeleivably amazing and the recoil makes it feel soo realistic. I strongly reccomend this game for 16+ people and hope its one of the best game you've ever played. (scammers,hackers will be on so a WARNING is NEVER TRUST ANYONE!)\n",

      "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game, multiplayer is a major part of the game as there is really no story involved but it's one of those games you can play from time to time for enjoyment to let off some steam maybe. Casual is a nice way to enhance your skill cap and to get better game sense and knowledge, the competitive aspect of this game is really reliant on teamwork, communication and skill which is why I really enjoy playing this with friends which is recommended. To get to the point, yes I recommend this game if you enjoy playing teamwork-reliant, competitive games by yourself or with friends.\n",
      " BIG ALPHA REVIEW I came into playing the \"Big Alpha\" for Evolve with low expectations, I have never played a game thats in Alpha before and expected a broken, barely playabale piece of trash, but I can pleasantly say that the Alpha is surprisingly well polished! THE GOOD STUFF The gameplay is exciting, I often find myself on my toes, always alert for the \"Monster has startled the birds icon\" I couldn't wait to spring into action with my team mates. Playing as the monster is just as exciting, always on the prowl, sniffing out your enemies as you devour the wildlife and become so powerful, the hunters become the prey.The classes the game provides (Assault, trapper, medic and support). Everyone has their own job and if one falls, the hunters may find it difficult to survive. The class system makes it important for Teamwork to exist within the game, making it a very good game to play with friends.Even on low graphics (had to turn it down due to optimization issues, more on that later) the game looks great, enviroments are lush and the dark, gloomy time setting makes the games atnosphere that much better THE BAD STUFF I've read other reviews and forums and it seems that alot of people are having issues with the game, even with powerful systems, admitedly my system isnt 'Top Tier' but it's no scrap yard and I was having issues running the game on High, to get a smooth, enjoyable experience I had to turn the graphics down to Low. However I didn't expect much less, it is in Alpha after all.The loading times took ALONG time, I mean 10-15 minutes long just to get into a bloody level! I kept having audio issues, gun sounds repeatedly going off when I wasn't firing etc, quite irritating THE CONCLUSION It's good, its very good....FOR AN ALPHA, you need to keep that in mind when playing something that isn't a full release, the devs have already said they are continuing to add on to this game and have a very clean, polished game out in Febuary.I highly recomend this, unfortunately I am writing this on the last day, I will ofcourse try to get a couple more hours in, so lets hope the full game is as pleasant as this.\n",
      "Counterstrike: Global Offensive truly differs from the other modern AAA shooters that are released. PROS:-CS:GO has a variety of game modes that appeal to the general fan base of first person shooters (Such as Deathmatch and Arms race) but keeps its core focus on the classic 5V5 diffuse mission that every Counterstrike fan knows and loves.-The game encourages team tactics and cooperation between team mates, which can be difficult due to the occasional prat who decides to wedge the bomb inbetween the car next to T spawn and a wall. But when you DON'T have a team mate with the IQ of a drooling two year old you can effectively develop stratergies that work with your team , whether its full of strangers or some of your closest friends. Friendships are made!-The mechanics of the game push a new player through a steep learning curve with difficult recoil control or making sure they stay fairly quiet, both of these things can ruin first impressions but can easily be learnt and adapted to over time.-There is a wide variety of maps with ocasional DLC coming out every season containing new maps and weapon skin cases.CONS:-The \"Valve Anti-Cheat\" doesn't seem to be working that well Gabe, now, this may just be a personal issue seeing as the servers you auto-connect to depend on your region (The oceanic reigon for yours truly). But I constantly run in to people with obvious aim-cheats, wall-cheats etc etc which really ruins the game.-I got a ban for \"kicking too many people in previous games\"...excuse me? I consider myself to be a pretty fair guy and I understand that not everyone can 4K clutch, so I only vote to kick someone if they're doing worse than a BOT would or being a giant ♥♥♥♥, in these cases, these players were being tremendous knobs (killing team mates, throwing the bomb into unreachable places, playing rap music down their microphone etc) Therefore I the teams I was playing on came to a mutual agreement to kick the players, I just think the reason for the ban is a load of cack.-Aaah yes, Skin cases, now, I'm not really considering this a \"con\" as its not Valves fault for making me spend that much money T.T only open cases/crates if you have the money! You will regret itDespite the couple of negative things I had to say, I give counterstrike a whole heartedly 9/10, if a game can make me as angry as this one can, it means it deserves a pretty solid rating. I recomend this game to any one thinking of getting it but with a warning, this game is harder to learn than your average shooter, don't go in with the mind-set that you're going to wreck people in your first day, you won't, and thats good, its just the beggining soldier.\n",
      "It is a worth buying game that you can either play with your friends or on your own,and you won't find it hard even you are playing single player campaign.You won't regret buying it after you have played this game\n",
      "Terraria is a great game its better than minecraft in some ways like more weapons armor blocks etc its also great to play with friends and its a cheap game to play unlike some other bulding games i give Terraria a 80/100\n",
      "How about a map, friend? Couldnt play more than 5 minutes\n",
      "unturned is a great game considering thats its free to play and personaly i like survival games such as rust but i'd rather play this    free game than playing a ten dollar game. Also Unturned is very creative with the items you can pick up and is one of the best free to play games if not the best survival games i've played in its early stages. But it has some down sides to it, although it's in its early stages it has some multiplayer bugs and glitches which makes the game hard to enjoy. Also it doesn't have any \"proper\" servers, i had to get my friends and i to make our own. And i don't really like the crafting setup because it is hard to know what to craft and how to make the items in the game. i know this game is still very early and is being made by one guy but hopefully in its complete stages the game will be one of the best survival games out there and will be enjoyed by millions...Good Luck with the game\n",
      "Very good game, could be played on most PCs and is a good game to play with friendsRating 8.5/10\n",
      "This game is perfect for crits and giggles. Better with friends!\n",
      "Absolutely amazing game! Nice peaceful music, ships stay with your character even in other servers/saves. All enemys are randomly generated, so if you and your friends go to a planet, nothing there will have a name until you make one up, and then others on the server can call it that too. You wont have much of an idea what enemy you are talking about unless there are names. The game feels really good and pretty smooth, although the FPS isn't the best. I feel that most of the races are solid, although i would never play as the apes, and the Avian race is definitely my favorite.\n",
      "I came for what it advertised, a multiplayer platformer with the ability to import your own playlists and have the level sync to the music, and I got what I came for. The controls are not the best, and at least one level is impossible with most of my songs, and the multiplayer seems sketchy, but it works and it was worth the 70c I payed for it. Its a nice game to play for 5-10 minutes with friends, but you can get bored of it quickly. I dont recommend it as a platformer, but as a casual, lighthearted multiplayer game with a cool graphic style, nice music and an awesome gimmick.\n",
      "such a good game, but needs to work on how quick the cannibals arrive to your location and the multiplayer, myself and some friends play the multiplayer but i cant seem to see any sharks or fish\n",

      "Got Bashed with a rock in the first few seconds of spawning, but seriously once you get into it it's really fun especially with friends.\n",
      "Thrilling and entertaining co-op game , play with your friends !\n",
      "This game is probably the best Valve game I have played! So much fun and the custom maps are cool. Great game if you like to shoot zombies with some friends :)\n",
      "Nothing spells teamwork better than charging at an infected horde with a melee weapon in hand to save a friend who got barfed on by a Boomer while another teammate of yours flings a Molotov Cocktail in your general direction and the last guy plays SNIPER ELITE with a hunting rifle miles away from the main conflict.10/10\n",
      "Very fun game, lot of longevity and gameplay. Also alot of mods to play around with friends\n",
      "All bugs are fixed and working great very good. good game and friend. very MUCH! revie i at 8/10\n",
      "This is a really fun game to play with friends or even with randoms, it's just a really good game to play. Reeeeeal good...\n",
      "By far the best zombie game i've played in ages, just as good as Day Z or 7 days to die. This game is set in an open world and works like a real world zombie apocalypse if you die you dont respawn you just change characters and keep going. If you tell an NPC to acompany you and they die, they are dead and you will never get them back.The story is awesome with you starting off with 3 people and slowly building from there while trying to get out of the place. Every playthrough is different because you could die early and make it so those 3 friends die before finishing the game.Apart from that there are also 2 completely different DLC's that just add to the chaos making the zombies harder and changing the map so you don't have to keep looking at the same place over and over again. They also bring in different types of playing, 1 telling you to go loud with military guns and weapons and the other takes a more stealthy approach to the game.I have got this game on PC and Xbox and love it on both it is a definite must have.\n",
      "i highly reccomend borderlands 2 as i has a good jump in jump out co-op which makes it a good game for me as if you need some help in a quest or just want to play some borderlands with your friends and just being able to leave whenever you want. i also like the full controller support as if you were a console user you can still use a controller or use a keyboard like tradditional PC gamers. I also love the style of the game simplistic but elegant and uses the cartoon graphics to its advantage. i also love the gameplay so many missions to choose from with many side quests to keep you busy and also the open world to run round finding all different types of weapons and loot to help you in your quests. All over a wonderful game to play and waste hours with friends. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I actually played 90% of this game with my friend and together we kicked evil people's butts, drove cars around at top speed, blew up random people to see how high they got, rammed those same people with a jet and enjoyed bumping into cops and getting chase after while \"stealthily\" shooting RPG directed towards those who apposed us. Yeah it was fun. 10/10 randomness. In one of the DLCs you can unlock a massive ball of yarn to drive down the street and cause mayhem.\n",
      "I really like the way the game plays and the strategy involved with you friends. Really good co-op game.\n",
      "Me and a couple friends got this game and went into it looking to make fun of it since it was made by a 16 year old. Once we played the game we realised that it is a great game (especially since it is free). Obviously the graphics are lacking and it is still only small but it has a lot of potential to grow into something amazing. More maps, better multiplayer, and a few other tweaks would improve it tons but other than that the gameplay is great.\n",
      "Well,I'm recommend this 'cuz,well,everyone like HL2 rigth? How about messing up with HL2 objects and characters?!  Garry's Mod is not really a game,cause it's uses things from HL2 and other games that use Source engine. But the most coll part is the add-on. No,seriously,EVERYONE can make a add-on for Gmod. Add-ons aren't just \"mods\",they can be buildings,maps,ect & etc.The multiplayer is not thaaaaaaaat good,but it's pretty fun when playing with friends in sandbox mode. Well,I recommend this game for those player that like to have fun with Source(Ps:Never,never,play a server in a sandbox mode,it has a ton of useless add-on that dosen't work.)\n",
      "If you mix Clue, The Sims and A first person shooter this is what you get, endlessly entertaining, great multiplayer.This game will test friendships like no other.\n",
      "GG me and my friend had a 3 hours fight in this game and we loved it\n",
      "What at first seems like a combination of minecraft,battlefield and TF2 ends up being a really,REALLY bad game.Let's start with the classes,or better said: The class.90% of the players in every server will be the sniper,why? Easy to control,fast,moderate health,long distance attacks and most of the time 1-2 shots kill,that being said,most of the servers will be about snipers trying to camp outside of the enemy base before the others,and after that,the next 20 minutes of the game are about snipers spawn-camping.What else? Lag,lots of. In games like CS GO I usually get 90 ping,but in every server in AoS I'll probably get 120 if lucky.Conclusion: Don't buy this game unless you have friends to play,if that's the case,you can get about 3 hours of fun from this game. 3.5/10\n",
      "CS:GO, The the skill required, the stratagie, the smooth movements, these are only some of the great things about this game, the game is fun to play with friends or to play competativly, it might be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes but once you get through that and start getting good, it isn't such a pain\n",
      "Killing Floor is one of the best co-op games on steam. There, i said it, it even rivals Portal 2 and Day Z in my mind. For $19.99, it might be a bit overpriced, but lower the price to $14.99 or $9.99 and you've got yourself a great deal! 6 player co-op in a wave based system was a great idea that sounds a little like Call of Duty: Zombies, but i assure you, this is a completly different expirence. Most maps are around 9 waves long with a 10th \"Boss Wave\" to finish the game. Through out the game, you can buy guns, melee wepons, grenades and body armor, but on the higher difficulty levels, it seems you never have enough cash to buy what you want, which means going without that badass shotgun or that samurai sword for yet another round.Final Words: If you have some steam friends, get the boys or girls together for some great zombie killing!\n",
      "Heaps on cool weapons, tons of fun especially with friends\n",
      "I love it! I love the workshop stuff, sandbox, gamemodes. and especially, having fun with my friends!\n",
      "One of the most rage inducing games, and you need to play it, If you love getting constantly punched in the ♥♥♥♥ (or ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I don't discriminate), you will love this game, and, If you don't love getting constantly punched in genitalia, you love it even more, this was my opening to the world of rogue like games. I cannot recommend this enough, and, my real life friends (I know right, rare) cannot shut me up about this game.This game beats me, and makes me feel useless, but then again, I could never stay mad at it, because deep in its heart, I know it loves me, well I think it does anyways, I mean it beats me because it loves me, you wouldn't understand.\n",
      "Amazing game! It pulls on a lot of skills to make a successful heist. You need a good team, a team that communicates and a team that has experience.Play with friends and RP a little! Makes it heaps better!Worth every cent!\n",
      "This game is awesome!play with friends and plan it out like a real heist and it makes the game so much more fun!if this game was made into a movie, i would watch it so much!\n",
      "Fun Fast pace action more fun with friends <3\n",
      "Of of those \"ten minute games\", if you really could call it a game.  I reccomend playing it, its not like it costs anything.  I really like the fish tank, it exemplifies the term \"next gen\" like nothing else.  Great game to play with your friends.  Great at parties.\n",
      "Amazing game. Got plenty of hours clocked offline and online and still not bored. Good range of weapons and heists. Updated regularly with plenty of new stuff.You can even buy cute, innocent masks, kill thousands of law enforcers and still look fabulous. Highly recommended if you like fixing drills and lying on the floor shouting at your friends when they don't pick you up.\n",
      "This game fuses comedy and first person shooters, this game is insured to keep you interested in playing for hours on end. There is a user friendly premium mechanic which allows you to become a premium member by simply purchasing something from the in-game store. This is actually one of the best mechanics I have ever seen. There are some items in the shop that sell for only 50 cents which is not that much financially. So basically pay 50 cents and get 300 more back pack slots and a hat. Upgrading to premium allows the player to find more items just by walking around a server shooting their friends in the face.\n",
      " have not played this game for 2 years and it was good then now you don't run out of things to do like there are so many bosses now it makes for an etertaning time with friends\n",
      "Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn is a awesome game with beautiful and stunning Graphics, just beacause they failed to create this before dosn't mean the new one is going to bad! i recommend buying this game! Awesome Content, Dungeons, Guild hiests, and a  awesome Story line! explore a massive world with your friends. Grind against your buddys to get the best gear!Also if you get bored on your class you can choose another class or all of them and still keep your old class. theres all different type of skills like (Disciples of War: Archer, Gladiator, Lancer, Marauder, Puglist,) (disciples of Magic: Arcanist, Conjurer, Thaumaturage) (Disciples of Hand: Alchemist, Armorer, Blacksmith, Carpenter, culinarian, Goldsmith, Leather worker, Weaver,(Disciples Of Land: Fisherman, Botanist, Miner.

      "DISCLAIMER - This is written from a perspective of someone who played this game back in 2015I know that this is early access and I'm probably writing about an earlier version of the game. From my experience, it didn't forfill how I thought this game was going to be from the trailers and such. At the time of playing it, this game was riddled with bugs, its performance was absolute crap and I just didn't find myself giving the patience needed to really get into this game because I honestly didn't know where to start, and my friend wasn't very happy either with what I convinced him to buy with me.Now I know alot of people will disagree, maybe I'm just getting boring as a person, I'm not sure.But my experience with this game just honestly didn't captivate me in time before I grew very bored of it.\n",
      "Used to mock this game with my friend about the title...Nice friend bought it for me to play with him...I find out its actually decent..This game is quite a laid back fps shooter that is great mindless fun with your friends and is a great steal off the steam sale.Try not to let the title decieve you because it may suprise you.7/10\n",
      "Portal 2 is the second and latest installment in the portal series, in the portal series you solve puzzles.. with portals! I would like to start off by stating that I absolutely love this game in every way imaginable. If you don't want to read the rest of this review then all I can say is just purchase it because this a game that I would love to forget about and start over with.Storyline:The storyline in this is just amazing and is one of the things that keeps you going and playing through this game, no matter how hard the puzzles are, and just when you think you have had enough it just hooks you back in again for more.Gameplay:The majority of Portal 2's gameplay consists of puzzle solving right from the start. At the start puzzle solving is relatively easy and quite simple, but once you start getting into it, it slowly gets more difficult as you progress through the test chambers, and they always keep it interesting when adding new elements to the tests every now and again. One thing is for sure though, you will find yourself getting stuck and maybe even a bit frustrated but a small break to re-gather your thoughts is all it takes to figre out a puzzle.Atmostphere:One thing that this game is best at is making you feel lonely. The emptiness of the ambience and soundtrack is really all it takes to make you feel alone, and this is probably one of the best features it has. The soundtracks that were picked for this game are just incredible at creating an amazing atmostphere.Coop:Coop is just a load of fun with your friends, it really is just fun to mess around with them, block their portals and just do whatever the hell you want. That's not saying that you can't be serious as well.Overall:I really do think that Valve thought this game out well, and created an amazing experience. Especially with all this content included it really is such a bargain to grab off a steam sale.11/10 Amazing\n",
      "This game is the definition of fun. Basically you blow up everything in sight and terrorize the government and people of Panau in an absolutely massive world thats around 1,000 square kilometers big. I know I have little hours in this game but multiplayer mode has been the main reason I bought this game and it is twice the fun of the base game as you can do all of the above but with friends!8.5/10 Best I don't give a F*ck simulator of all time.\n",
      "this game is awesome GET THIS GAME OMG it's so good hours of fun with friends and it never gets old\n",
      "♥♥♥♥ing fun with friends!\n",
      "A good game, but it has pros and cons (like all games)ProsThe gameplay and strategy are really very good. Playing with friends is pure fun. The ships are interesting which give you the incentive to try and level up to get new starships.A very deep crafting system, but alot of the time you will find you sell swimming in money, as a lot of simple things you find or craft sell for alot. Some people will like this (including me, which is why i put it pros)ConsThe Storyline is a bit boring, you don't really listen to the dialogue since there is no voiceovers, which just leaves you like a henchman doing what everyone tells you to do not knowing what the outcome is.The missions are very repetitive, you really just go around scanning things in space, and that occasional ground mission or space fight, which, are not that bad.Overall, I would give this game a 7/10.Not a bad game at all.\n",
      "This is a fun game that I enjoy playing, as you can see with my hours. It has a good story, characters and enemies. This is a good game to play with friends, the more friends you have playing the game with you, the harder the enemies are and the better loot you get. It has thousands of weapons and grenade mods, that you can choose from as you get further into the game. This game is about 30 hours long to complete the story if you are just wondering around, searching every area for epic loot. Overall, this game is great to play with friends, and has HEAPS of EPIC LOOT in every area.\n",
      "Such a great game to play of a night/day with friends, The game can be frustrating and it is difficult to stay stealthy but once you get the hang of the game you won't be able to stop playing and will most likely end up purchasing all the DLC's for about 15 bucks. Highly reccommended game!\n",
      "Rage Simulator 2015This game is so good that it can ruin your relationship with your girlfriend, ruin your friendship and ruin your life in general.Be prepared to face smurfs, squeakers, hackers, mic spammers and dont forget ragers.Enjoy maps like Crackferno, Tram, miRage, Cashe, nake and everyones favourite (and hated) Dank 2. Maps full of camping spots, sniping spots, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t spots and ninja spots. Trade skins which have absolutely no point in being in the game other than being currency and showing off to your friends.

So, I downloaded it, got on a server with one of my friends... 2 seconds later, I'm having the time of my life! Team Fortress 2 is and exiting fast-paced game that has many classes all with strengths and weaknesses... It's fun to both become a Heavy or Pyro and just oblitherate everything in your path, and to become a Medic or Spy to try to be tactful and sneaky... No matter what your into, Team Fortress 2 is perfect! I strongly recommend absolutly anyone to pick up this game, and play!\n",

This new 2D take on the MOBA genre is generally a great game, and, while the matchmaking could use some work, the devs are constantly improving the game (They have promised to improve the matchmaking, so hopeat issue is soon resolved)I hope this review convinced you to buy the game! The devs definitely deserve it!\n",

      "Possibly one of the greatest games of the generation and the only game I won't ever regret pumping nearly THREE YEARS into.      The engaging combat system, reminisent to Ocarina of Time, is satisfying, brutal and not without its problems. Some of these problems include cheesing PvP with the use of backstabs and many of the deeper nuances not explained by the game at all. The game also boasts a subtle yet epic story, using item descriptions and character dialoge as the only sorces. However this is not a bad thing as it compels you to be more active and thaughtful in and out of the game. To this day, all I can do with my friends is argue about things like the godess Velka and the chronology and the events, the game's predicesors and the upcoming sequel. The game also has a very large and active community as people argue about lore, hold PvP turnaments etc. It is also exceedingly emersive with briliant voice acting, gorgeous sound assets and a musical score that will leave you in awe, make you cry and make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself all at the same time. However before purchasing this masterpiece, you must be aware of the plathera of problems it holds. Some of these are low texture quality, low screen resolution, 30fps lock, almost unusable with a keyboard and mouse, extreme frame drops and a staggering amount of bugs. However ALL of these problems can be fixed with the multitude of mods available for PC. Praise the Sun!\n",
      "DO YOU LIKE SIMPLE, EASY TO LEARN GAMES? WELLthis game probably isn't for you unless you're into learning alot of sh*t in the game.Machinecraft looks nice and IS nice but in the first hour of playing you will go \"WHY WON'T THIS WORK?!?!?\" then you play for another few hourse then go \"HOW DO I MAKE THIS WORK!?!!?\" then you hit the 10-hour mark. After 10 hrs of playing you can now make simple machines like a car, after 50 hrs you make your first plane, after a few 100 failed attempts on how to make and fly one ofcourse. Then the 100-hr mark and you can now make comples stuff but theyre not so polished, then the 200-hr mark (which I have currently), you make your first *insert a unique type of machine here*, after that you now realise that you could've done something with your life with the 200 hours you spent in the game. The game is proud of you, you, your friends, your family not so much.\n",
      "This is not a good game. It is an excellent game.Do you live for taking photos, and enjoy lighthearted videogames about friendship?Well have I found the game for you. It's over there, in some other pile.Oh. You want to hear about this game?Well.This game is for you if you enjoy having your heart ripped out and stomped on. Just a little. If you're the sort of person who empathizes with characters, you will hate this game. You will also love this game. You are going to choose. You are going to get it wrong. You will always get it wrong. Even when you get it right, you will get it wrong. I hope you enjoy your time having your brain give up and your heart break.\n",
      "I have spent countless of hours on this game and it was so much fun, joing a party with mates and smashing zombies heads in with frying pans. It really is something uniqie, it hasn't got a direction, you just play how you want and make your own fun. eg. in a sesh with some friends and you see a witch.....shouldn't shoot it....but you do, this is what makes this game awesome.But the visuals are rather medicore and should have been so much better at the time of its release. The gore is cool,the action is cool but the story is ♥♥♥♥, but thats ok becasue this game doesn't need a story it needs more weapons and MORE ♥♥♥♥ING MODS!!!!!! Enjoy 8/10\n",
      "Fantastic game, even better with friends, just be friendly to other players or at least warn them before you kill them\n",
      "Great game, better to play with friends. 10/10\n",
      "Rust, well I could go on and write an essay on why you should buy this game but just to give a few poinbt and keep it short i would like so share ssome of my experieences and thoughts. My first 3 hours or so i was lucky enough to be left alone with no contact with any other players, I learnt how to craft and build my first shack where i made a campfire and hid inside of till daylight. I was playing with one of my friends and we found each other after about those 3 hours, I learnt the basics of the game within that time and managed to make a starting weapon and go on to hunting.Ok rust has issues and bugs here and there, but although it is only in alpha it is one of the best games i have played, on my second realtime day of playing rust i made 2 new friends and next thing you know we all built together hunted together and ofcorse raided less fortunate players together.My most memorable moment is when me and this group of mine we all sprinting through the pitch black night, armed to the teeth with weapons, armor and explosives, all you could see were our lazer pointers and flashlight atatchments, we arrived at a base 5x the sive of ours and with many c4 explosives we broke through and found the mother of all loot, we killed the people that were asleep and destroyed their sleeping bags, Harsh? we know, but after playing rust for a couple hours u will relise its survival of the fittest.Overall 20$ for a game that is only in alpha stage and has so much potential??? i think so, u would be insane to pass this offer.\n",
      "This is game is really fun to play with friends and has a very good community. This game is recommended for those WWII lovers and just fps gamers in general. Great graphics and smooth gameplay.\n",
      "when DayZ meets minecraft, makes it a pretty addictive game to play alone or with friends.\n",
      "I bought this game to play with friends, then not being able to (because we couldnt make a sever) i continued to playing single player. after a few hours, i was hooked. Its great.GOOD:-Fun for single and multiplayer-Easy to get used to-Quite the challenge at times.Knowing that theres so much more to come (such as ship creativity, more races, more bosses, more crafting) i cant really write a bad part of the review, anything i would of said will be in the game soon(hopefully) anyway.DEFINATELY a game worth the price.10/10 for an early access.\n",
      "Dayz? Step aside. This game allows to immerse youself in the world of the wretched zombies. You as an unturned human must scavenge the abandoned islands to survive, thrive and escape. With the next generation of flawless graphics, awesome AIs and insane items. If that is not enough, there is multiplayer mode which allows you and your friends to go through the experience of an apocalytic event together!The games is still under developement but think about what it would be when it is complete! 10/10.\n",
      "Great game, alot of variation in playstyles, more fun when played with friends.\n",
      "Really great game. Fun to play with friends. Based of dayz. Its perfect if you dont have enough computer power to run dayz like myself. This game brings back memories of dayz Arma 2 mod.\n",
      "I was never that into Coop Platforming games (I'm more of an FPS gamer) and I got the Best Friends Forever pack from a Humble Bundle. After playing this with one of my friends, I have to say that this is an extremely fun platforming game, that is both relaxing and difficult.Things I loved about the game:- Visual Quality (it is so smooth and the particles effects are awesome).- Puzzles (The start of the game was quite easy, but once you played through, the puzzles took me a while to think of what to do).- Using momentum to beat puzzles (it's so satisfying).Problems I had with the game:- A little bit laggy when playing with a friend (that might just be my internet, although other games are fine when I play them).- Voice chat in game is a 2 second delay (but you will probably use Skype, Tamspeak etc. anyway).I would give this a solid 9/10. Definitely recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "awesome game fun to play and friendly people\n",
      "Great game to play with friends money friendly worth buying and playing\n",

      "You're not going to get much more than what you see here, but what there is is a well made extremely tight 2D platformer fencing simulator that is extremely fun to play with friends, maybe not as interesting against a CPU, recommend picking it up on sale because that price is pretty high for something with so little meat, even if it is quite tasty\n",
      "Very fun game, very good looking, and a great concept, combat can be abit daunting at first but once you catch on its very funpersonal my fave class is archer with short range bow standing in the thick of it defintely more fun with friendsgraphics-9gameplay-8audio-7community-5 (mainly because nobody speaks on the servers much)\n",

      "[Outline]Best zombie game ever, Slice zombies into slices, Low violence in Australia/ Barely any bodies, No blood on screenSo, What this is, Is basically get from Point A to Point B. Then load. Then B to C. This sounds monotone to you but if you play with friends it's going to be the best. Left 4 Dead 2 brings you a 4 player co-op, Zombie killing game. If you ever get bored with the game well, Their are mods on the workshop. This game does have a bit of story to it, The Crew start off at a hospital(No Mercy) and must GET DA THE CHOPPAH, HEIRGH. Well. It picks up from there and goes into the second campaign, One of my favourites was... Well I forgot, I just know it had a choppah and The Second Crew was there.Heh. 9/10 for me <3 Only didn't get a Ten because of the Point A to point B thingRemember Kids: GET DA CHOPPAH, HEIRGH\n",

      "READ THISRight now this game crashes when too many entities full the screen, or I fly into a town. My computer can run heavily modded and graphically enhanced Minecraft, Dayz, etc, but 7D2D crashes.This isnt much of a problem as 7D2D closes instantly and only takes about 10 seconds to open up as it loads extremely quickly.What IS the problem is that THERE'S NO MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION, so if you find a gun, build a house and store supplies, it can crash without autosaving and send me back an hour. However I do have a 32-bit OS, which may be the cause of crashes I don't know.I WOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT HAS A MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION the lack of one is shocking in a game that rewards you for putting in time (e.g to contruct a fort, play around in creative, etc.) The autosave it does have seems to trigger at certain intervals, but there's no way to trigger it yourself or toggle it. And sometimes it works every 3 minutes, and sometimes it still dosen't work after 1 hour! That might be just my computer though. I wouldn't reccomend 7D2D as of yet, but with a manual save function I would. When it works it is great fun, especially with friends.\n",
      "Great game but if you don't have friends then multiplayer is practically unplayable, because of a lack of dedicated servers. I would have made my own server, but for some reason I don't have an Ipv4 address, so I can't.This game would be 8 or 9 out of 10 for me if it had dedicated servers.\n",
      "I recommend this game because its just like playing call of duty zombies but with robots and an endless wave of pure fun.Final Rush will be better if the multi-player was available so you can play with your friends plus the graphics are very nice and also the sound quality as well. But the only problem is the video settings, the only thing you can change is your resolution of your screen.\n",
      "Fantastic Game! Was accused of stealing my friend's refinery, so I killed him with a space drill\n",
      "Altogether a great game, so many possibilities in what you can add into the game or even make yourself. The multiplayer community is quite large, and the many differant game modes available each gives a differant gaming experience... Within G-Mod there is many gaming experiences to be had, alongside friends or just complete randoms, being a jerkwad in the sandbox servers, wreaking havok in the Dark RP servers, you name it, it can happen in gmod if you put your mid to it.I rate this game 8/10, not giving it full potato because of the age of this game and the sheer amount of errors and blank textures you will come accross, but it gains its solid 8 from the graphics, gameplay and sanbox capabilities.\n",
      "Rage inducing platformer that leaves a bloody reminder of how terrible you are after each restart. Great game to play with friends. WARNING! Homicidal Tendencies are amplified during your play through. The game does not hold your hand which is to be commended. A real sense of accomplishment is felt after completing the tougher stages which I have found to becoming less present in todays Video Games. Highly Recommended.\n",

      "now i could say bad or good things about this game but i shall say both. this game is like battlefield 3 and its squad basedd gameplay is really fun vehicles are excellent sci fi but the cintrols for them arent friendly to new comers but in the end i give this game a good enough score of 7.8\n",
      "Best Competitive FPS.Having had little experience with CS, this sort of game was new to me, and at first, it seemed like a pointless grind, boring, only fun with friends.I quit, 6 months later I return, to find myself a SIlver 1 scrublord, yet despite this, it has grown on me.I cant turn on my PC and open steam without thinking, screw anything else, I want to play CS:GOBasically this is how it works.Get Kill with P90-You ♥♥♥♥ing son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ noob scrub, what a noob wepDie with p90-ha you gay ♥♥♥♥, you had noob weps and you failed, hahahahaKill with AK acrros long distance- U ♥♥♥♥ing aimbotting ♥♥♥♥Get KIll through smoke-Wallhacks ♥♥♥♥ off noob, go back to deathmatchMiss easy AWP shot- are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?

      "A nice sandbox but this one tends to focus on some fun crafty modes which s fun it you have a group of friends or people to play with such as Prop hunt, Sandbox, PvP, Terror in Terrorist town and some other creative stuff. Includes props and stuff from most of the valve games such as Half Life (Mainly) and Team Fortress. Steam Workshop is available. Game used to make Youtube's Gmod movies and other projects.A microphone is recommend if you' re playing in a co-op mode to increase the fun. But mind some of the ragers with mics if you find any. It has a moderator system in case this or something else happens. But other than that averagely nice sandbox.\n",

      "The Lost Mythologies is an amazing work of art, stunning visuals, great storyline (if you speak chinese, but they are working on an english version), and a great clear to proceed, hack n slash combat syste. However, its not without its bugs. There were a few minor bugs thats were more of an inconvenience than anything else and easy to work around, like health pots not giving health, then you have the big bugs, UI not disappearing when you unpause (restart game to fix), falling through the world, (exit to menu and restart to fix), enemies taking at least 100 hits and still not dieing (reinstall to fix). Then you have my situation were i had to skype call me chinese friend and screen share to know what was being said on the little scrolls that appear, and finally figuring out how to beat the first area, go to options, set lock mode to hold, hold shift for the rest of the game while pressing f near enemies and spaming mouse buttons.Overall it is a good game, but needs a little more attention than a english translation.\n",
      "An amazing game to soothe yourself to. The puzzle element makes this game really fun. But it isn't as fun as other games with friends, I suggest playing this game if you find yourself with no friends online a lot.\n",
      "Great time consuming game! Addicting singleplayer, with easy achievements. And an even better multiplayer, conquering hordes of mobs with friends. And arming yourself to the brim with new and exciting item upgrades. This game has a lot of potential, i'd like to see more enemies, items and character customisations! Overall score= 6/10 \"Simple, challenging and addictive.\n",
      "BL2 wow what a game, funny as hell,  even more fun with firends!this game has a really greeat storyline an makes you want to play it more jsut make sure to bring a friend/sthe dlc where lacking in the fact there was no level cap increase for your character till the last few dlc but if you were to buy this as a game of the year edition it would be alot of fun!golden keys were dissapointing but the guns threw quests made up for that as they should even tho you would think using the keys at cap level would get you sum amazing artillery nope think again.There are amazingly hard boss's to defeat which require the right set of skills and a full group to go destroy them to collect special krystals which can be redeemed for awesome loot! (warning: this is no walk in the park scene)  overall i would recommend this to my friends an public. have always enjoyed the borderlands universe go check it out for yourself Twitch.tv/Count_Douch\n",
      "huge zombies fan.this is the game that started the call of duty zombies!if you want to havea bit of fun with four friends then this is a must, the commuinty have modded the zombies and you will have to look for the mods online,but it will add tons more hours of gameplay to your skull blasting in this game!the mechanics are ok! (compared to the updated black ops 1/2 zombies) but this shows you why the game style became so popular dont pass this if your a COD Zombies Fan!Count_Douch\n",

I have lots of new online friends now, and most of them are the Developers - Philphax and Trix and Woet!!! They are the best online game developers that I have seen in quite a while, so if you have JC2, and are considering getting this mod, GET IT IMMEDIATELY.\n",

      "My IMO score: 10/10Why?Don't have to answer Roman's calls anymore because he isn't in the game.Seriously though here are my points:Story: I haven't played it yet but based on my brother's gameplay,it is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts. There are also a lot of twists in the story.The inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective Special Abilities. Cheat codes are fun too!Online: I played about 99% of my time in Online. The community as I expected is SOS or shoot-on-sight kind of players so you don't really have a room for making friends. The real fun comes when you are playing with your friends. The jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money.Beware though,vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle.  It will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too! Although they are very expensive, they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse. They also give your owned cars a safe place where other players can't blow them up and you have to call the Insurance company to get it back. The most expensive ones looks something that only Iron Man can buy,hell, the Garage already looks like a house.HEISTS:  my favourite part of Online. They are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications. The succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon. It gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader (I got 200k once). The problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1). Noobs who cant do ♥♥♥♥. 2.) People who don't know what to do. 3.) people who Perform their roles poorly and 4.)just incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who sit around ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you and possibly others are getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by the police. However, when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew, you can have actually fun and it doesn't even feel that you are competing. You also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast. Optimization: Hell, this console port doesn't even feel like it! Truly the PC Master Race has prevailed. The graphics looks very beautiful. The streets and cities are very lively. The effects are truly stunning. All this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications:GTX 860M(Single)Intel Core i7-4710HQ 2.5Ghz-3.416 GB RAM.It runs around 40-60 FPS on Very High settings with no AA and on 1920x1080!There is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isn't really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing GTA V constitently.Well, that's all I could say for this review. This review will be updated as the game also updates on PC\n",
      "This has to be one of the best co-op games I have ever played. The graphics are great, the gameplay is fun and it is the most fun when playing with friends. The storyline could be a little better but it is still great. i would give it 9/10.\n",
      "Amazing Game, i love playing it with friends and am having a really good time with the fighting and unlockables\n",
      "Awesome game, so fun to play, better than COD and my friends play it, so I too play it aswell!\n",
      "Stardew Valley is a brilliant game, simple on the surface with its funny pixelart graphics and relaxing farm mechanics but delivers hours of fun and entertainment with the vast variety of new experiences, fishing with a fun mingame, foraging, farming, mining and making friends. I highly recommend this game to any fan of harvest moon, starbound or just a farming game in general.Also you can get high with a wizard in his tower!10/10\n",
      "It's fun to think with portals.This is an amazing game, it's funny, challenging and takes a long time to finish. Lots of re-play ability and with a friend, the multiplayer is a blast. This is one of my all time favourite games!I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Great sandbox game, awesome fun with friends. The range of multiplayer modes proves how good the game is. I recommend it to anyone looking for another game.\n",
      "This game literally broke my mouse. It broke my sleep schedule. It broke my sanity. My friends and family are worried about me, hearing me talking nonstop about cubes that can roll and UFOs.10/10 would do it again.Bonus headaches included for free. Guaranteed to be better than the porygon episode.\n",
      "One of the best if not the best survival/apocaliptic/pvp experiences I have ever had within a game. I enjoy this MORE than DayZ and so should you. Its best to play with friends but its possible to make new friends along the way...as well as about 1000000 enemys of course! Its the feel of this game that I love, and its FREE TO PLAY! Its a MUST HAVE!\n",
      "great fun game, good fun to play with friends...you will indefinately need a mousei would reccomend this for people who are looking for a game to play with friends. if your looking for the real steam experience your looking at it. only one real nit pick, guess it would be the file size, but your looking at a good game, also the maps take a long time to load (dont hate, my internet not that good)this is a great game\n",
      "Dota 2, where to startThis game has given me many positive and negative memories, the good times. Playing with friends, cooperative teammates, the bad times. Bad connections and foul teammates. If there is one thing this game gets correct is that it helps to teach team work, its almost impossible to win by yourself. Thank you Dota!\n",

      "It's a great game, even better if you play with your friends .\n",
      "Amazing so far, you'll start off in a multiplayer server and maybe you'll meet some people.. you might kill them or might make friends.. or tie them up then slowly torture them in a cave. after that you'll probably be ambushed by the bane of your very existence, Stygmilochs before getting a actual camp set up, You will build a small shelter. After that  you'll survive for a bit before getting your first herbs and taming a Dinosaur.. after that you'll either become a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and kill everyone on sight or help newbies.\n",
      "Now before I begin, Team Fortress 2 is an epic first person shooter game from the start. A summary of the story would be how two companies (teams) are fighting to claim land. 9 mercenaries have been hired to fight for the land. Each mercenary is quite different from each other, and have their own specific role. The game is quite fun and is mostly focuses on team work, and communicating. You also find and trade tons of weapons, gear and, hats throughout the game. The game is not pay to win as you can find every weapon in the game :P, and if you find the same weapon you can craft them into different weapons or hats!!! Another alternative is to trade with your friends online, or to buy them in the shop. Unlike most other games, team fortress 2 has many game modes, a few of them are: CTF, KOTH (King of the Hill), Payload( Move a bomb into the enemies base, and watch as it explodes :D), Capture control points, and boss fights! There are tons of maps you can play some made by the creators of tf2, Valve, and custom maps made by awesome people like yourself. There are many cool updates, in which new equipment and maps are added to the game. Want to see what people have created, and hope in adding? Then, visit the steam workshop for tf2 and explore! Hey, did I mention that even you, yes YOU can create an item in hope of it getting added to the game :D And on top of that people create thousands of funny, amazing animations using SFM(Source film maker) using TF2 :D. O and if you want to be different from the rest, well not to worry as you can customize how your mercenaries look like with hats, cosmetics and even more hats :D!Would rate it a 100/10\n",
      "Awesome game. Good fighter and amazing story. Never got tired of it. Also very fun with friends. Buy it. Now.\n",
      "Unturned is a very fun and surprisingly intense multiplayer game which I can definately recommend. Find food, clothes, weapons and fight the horde. Make friends or enemies with players and do battle, and construct forts equipt with metal doors, barbed wire, and a maybe personal helepad if you are lucky enough to aquire a helecopter. Unturned is great fun for friends who want to hang out, have fun and kill zombies. I would most recommend playing with a friend or group of friends on a personal or public server. There are plenty to choose from. :) Also props to the devs for consistant updating, performance improvements and bug fixes. New things are added all the time.\n",
      "A really nice, solid game, especially considering it was released in 1998. If you have a friend to play it with, its really fun. I don't recommend you get this game unless you have someone to play it with, so definately go with the 4 pack. Otherwise you'll be stuck dealing with immpossible enemies all by yourself and have no-one to laugh with, only yourself to yell at.\n",
      "If you want something out of the ordinary, competative challenge with comic book humour and lots of \"WTF\" moments then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you! A really fleshed out game with good balance and a unique playstyle thanks to the focus on team work and unique class system. These features make for a truly great game to play with your friends, and thanks to valve, ITS FREE! So what are you waiting for? Download it now!\n",
      "This game has alot of hate towards it about the graphics and no controller support and that, but this game, although challenging can be quite fun with friends\n",
      "I really wouldn't compare this game to other zombie survivals such as the Left 4 Dead Series and the Call of Duty Zombies series. I really enjoyed both series and have grown to love Killing Floors new take on gameplay such as the removal of Crosshairs and the lack of endless waves like CoD Zombies. The game has 7 classes. Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be. Simply put, Killing Floor might have a dead playerbase, but if you gather up some friends there's lots of fun to be had.Also.LODESAMONE.\n",
      "As a person who normally doesn't like strategy games this game was fantastic! Simple to play but really hard to master. Everything looks and feels very nice but the multiplayer could be better with the freezing but is fun with friends if it run smoothly\n",
      "Really fun multiplayer game! Well optimized and takes the best parts from the first game with now RPG elements. Only get this game if you have friends to play with because the bots are awfully useless. The game feels rushed with the levels (e.g. no 7 day heist) and the lack of safehouse customization. The game is great though!\n",
      "Very fun game to play with friends as long as you have a good connection. the game is still in development so I understand it has a few bugs but they make the game even more funny sometimes. I would definitly recomend this game to people who enjoy laughing\n",
      "♥ ♥ ♥ Overall ♥ ♥ ♥Fairly good game to play with friends using the Join feature, very envolving gameplay when you try to level up and complete dungeons to aquire more loot, appart from the long queues I definitely recommend it.☺☺☺ Pros ☺☺☺-> Private open world exploration with friends in Clubs feature.-> 11 Classes.-> Item rewards in Dungeons & Lairs equilibrated with death penalty.☹ ☹ ☹ Cons ☹ ☹ ☹-> In this version usually 30+ Minute queue.-> Low character customization ( Just face ).\n",
      "The starts pretty boring but with friends a must play!\n",
      "This game, is actually pretty fun to play. I don't even know why, but most of the reviews on this game have been negative.Real boxing, is a game where you can fight realistic CPUs in career, in places like Las Vegas, New York, Moscow and many others to unlock! Or, you can fight your friends, or some randoms in online. Another reason why this game is suitable for boxing fans, is because its like the only Boxing game on PC, or Steam.This game also provides blood, and scars on the face as you punch giving more realism to the game, the game does have some flaws, but I really recommend this game, unless you care about every little thing, then I wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Old desktop, dry cereal from the packet, saturday morning ritual.Those are the memories that hit me straight away when I think of this game, a game I devoted years to from adolescence to pubescence. Is it good? No.Is it too far beyond good for me to find words for? Yes.I can't tell you why this game was amazing and original and something so unique it has never been replicated.The best I can do is say the experience this game provides is worth more than I can say, buy it, I want my friends to buy it, I want everyone to play what is an amazing experience and if that doesn't sway you, hell i'll gift it.\n",
      "ME2 is possibly one of the best games i've played, i felt like i was in the game, making decisions that affected friends and foes. I would give it a 5 but it does have some glitches such as the Tuchunka Shop, i got stuck in the wall several times. But nonetheless, ill give it a 4.5\n",
      "Amazing strategy game to play by yourself or with friends. Easy to pick upbut still challenging. 9/10, everyone should play\n",

      "To me, this is a well-thought out Precision platformer requiring basically the four directional buttons for controls, esc for menu, and spacebar to restart.As of this writing, I am not past the 5th or 6th screen, and I refuse to continue because I do not take pleasure in overcoming smart & tricky af jumps only to meet another short tricky af obstacle course after-another after-another. Also, the lettering/font/type takes a few seconds too many to decipher at first. That's neat & quirky, but it gives me a microscopic headache every time I try to read characters' speech bubbles.'Still a freaking-damn great game for its price. Buy this for your friend.\n",
      "I've been playing this game since it's release in December of 2014, so I've got quite a bit of time on it. Right off the bat I'll say that this game isn't for everyone. If you're expecting all out action all the time then prepare to be disappointed, as there is A LOT of simple and sometimes unexciting travelling. This game has many roles that can be played out by the player whether it be a bounty hunter, trader or a pirate. The game's learning curve is also fairly steep and you won't find yourself travelling the entire galaxy or completing every bounty within the first few hours if not days.All in all, it's a great, polished game with depth to its combat, customization, and economy systems. If you love space simulators or just space in general and you've got the patience needed to get around the massive world that E:D offers then this game is just right for you. But this game also has its fair share of issues. The quests become repetitive, dull, and boring. You'll find yourself doing the exact same thing over and over with the only change being the location and names of quest givers. Don't be put off if you find it difficult the first few hours as this game isn't very casual friendly but soon enough you'll know exactly what you're doing and start your journey in no time. This is space exploration at its finest.Note: a joystick is recommended for this game but not necessary.Pros- Massive world- In-depth combat, customization and trading system- Great Visuals- Various roles to choose fromCons- Steep learning curve- Repetitive quests9.5/10\n",
      "A great game, loads of fun, best to play with a group of friends. 200+ hours for sure.\n",
      "This game has no point whatsoever, and that is what makes it fun. It is the perfect game to just muck around with friends on. It's currently only in beta, and if they make online multiplayer for it then that would be amazing. Still, you can play locally. I hooked up 3 controllers to a PC and played Starwhal and had a great time. Cool game.\n",
      "Tomb Raider 2013 was a great success and highly lives up to it's name with it's inovative mechinics, Inspiring soundtrack and emotional story.The mechinics of Tomb Raider are not just inovative in the sense of adding something new to the game but are inovative that the players can really use them to help them on their journey through the untold and mysterious legends and mysterys that surround the unusual island that you are trapped on. For example the ajustibillty of the bows equipment like the rope allowing you to glide around specific parts of the map and the mechanical pulley which you're rewarded with after completing a specific part of the game that allows you to travel even faster giving you the sense that you are in more control of the situation you are in on the island. I really enjoyed using the equipment for traveling through the map and for a more tactical way of dealing with your foes.The story of Tombraider draws you in and leaves you confused (In a good way, at first) as you start to put the peices of the mystery together. Tombraider slightly over exhagerates the emotions of Laracroft but they still made you feel her emotions and help you to see the changes in her as she progresses through the story. She starts in her adventure with the determination of uncovering the legend of the Sun Queen. As lara is faced with the challenges of the story like having to kill her first person or losing an important friend she is able to carry on with resilience and the determination she starts the story with. The story makes it feel like your discovering the mystery rather than your playing a character who is and is rewarding when you start to make sense of everything. I really enjoyed the story even if it was slightly shorter than I would of liked.The music if amazing and really compliments the emotions and scences in the game. Tomb raiders has a memorable sound track that is inspiring and compliments Lara's strength and determination in the story. The main theme song with Its suttle piano notes builds up the suspense and invigorates combat. I have even downloaded this song as it is an amazing instrumental.Overall this game was well worth the price I got it for ( $8.99 usd) and is worth alot more than that. It has some mistakes as any game but the don't bring my amazment of this inspirational game down. I highly recommend for an escape to another world or adventure and I cannot wait for the next game in the series.\n",
      "The best loot and shoot I've ever played.The co-op in this game is incredible, grab a friend and play to maximise your gameplay. If you love to murder marauders and loot their lifeless corpses, this game is for you!\n",
      "Wicked Game!DDE started out as a remake of Dungeon Defenders, which was an EPIC game (if i do say so myself). But since DDE's release its become something more then Dungeon Defenders, Because of its constant getting updated, its gotten alot more content and the leveling system was changed in Dungeon Defenders they level cap was eventually raised to lvl 100 which the intro of new patches. as where with Dungeon Defenders Eternity, all that content is already in, but the level cap is sitting back at the original cap of lvl 60, which allows alot more room for upgrades in the future.BY FAR THE BEST MMO Tower Defense game, i've seen out there. although its not fully a tower defense game, because you can also run around as a character and shoot, swing big ♥♥♥♥ swords, fire lasers, use magic projectile to kill you're enemies or you could just sit back and let you're towers and pets do the killing for you. This game covers alot of different play styles and is great fun with friends or by yourself.of course every game isn't without if flaws or boring parts. a couple of boring parts i've found are the massive grinds to get end level gear (although this might be boring, it can also be quite enjoyable). Dungeon Defenders Eternity took everything about Dungeon Defenders and made it even better.But don't take my word on it, play it for yourself and enjoy!!!\n",
      "Great game, even more fun with friends\n",
      "This is a good game if you like combat and at times it can get really fun and I like it how you can find weapons and it is fun to play as all the classes so I do recommend this game if you don't have it get it's free But you will need to buy stuff to be able to trade items away But even if you don't want to buy stuff you can get premuim from The Gift To Premuim items that your friend can buy for you but it is fun with out premuim anyway so  I do recommend this game so if you don't have it get play it and see if you will like this.\n",

      "Hey remember that one shooter that was fun but wasnt really the best.. No? of course you dont that is because there really never was a Planetside 1.. well if there is and I just dont know of it that is probably because people just dont speak of it... So Im gunna go ahead and review Planetside 2 like this. Imagine that one really fun game you played with your friends on Teamfortress except 10 TIMES THE GRAPHICS, THE PEOPLE, AND THE CHAOS. Yeah thats right you cant go walking in this game without being beheaded within like a minute! Because all the tryhard Infiltrators (definitely not me... ok fine me) are there ready for you but what is really funny is somehow NONE OF THIS ruins the experience, after many updates and I guess just growth of the game it has changed into a really popular faction based shooter that a lot of people play. Heil Terran. 9/10\n",
      "Maplestory. This game is by far the worst game ever created. The Characters are sh*t, The Animations for skills suck, The story lines are lame. How bad can one game be? The Story of an average mapler. One day a person randomly overhears some of his friends talking about maplestory. He gets curious so he finds out what it is and downloads the game. He starts to play the game, it isn't too bad, he makes friends, he has fun. - Few months later. The person gets addicted to the game and is \"mapling\" 24/7. He also spends $10 - $50 everyday for the Nexon's in-game currency known as \"Nexon Cash\" or \"NX\"After a while his friends disappear, and makes new friends and they disappear too.HE does this for 5 years until one day he looks at the game properly and thinks to himself. \"What have I done during the past 5 years?\" He then proceeds to view his purchase history, his characters, his life.What has happened during the past 5 years you may ask? Well. This person wasted his money, his time, his relationships and most of all his LIFE. It is far too hard to comeback from maplestory if you played it for such a long time, and when you do, I'll tell you, you will never look at the game the first time you looked at it. How \"innocent\" it is, How \"fun\" it is. The only exception you can see to is that you have friends whom play the game. Other than that I suggest you drop it.\n",

(even though i got it in a humble bundle a while ago that came with ALL dlc for only like 20 cents, but since then the tinkerers lab dlc came out which is the only one i dont have but i still have the series EV and REALY want it.) This game IS the best tower defense i have ever played and one of the best rpgs aswel! I beleive this game has great multiplayer where you can all play together and have HOURS of fun, its worth encouraging your friends or family to buy or even buying a copy for them! This game is amazing with loads of different enemies and maps, complete with randomly generated and dropped for you to pick up. Great game 10 out of 10\n",
      "When my boyfriend first got it, I said, \"Really? A game with cars and sports crossed over? That's so stupid, such a typical boys' game.\"This comment was quickly taken back after I watched Mr.Fruits' videos on it and desperately wanting to try it for myself. Without even trying my bf's game, he soon bought it for me.24 hrs later, I have spent a quarter of that time playing Rocket League. So, do I like it?Well, as Flo Rida once sang, \"I don't like it, I love it.\"\n",

      "Okay straight off the bat, I did not like this game at all, for like, two reasons.Reason No1: The lag is ♥♥♥♥in' unbeliveable. I suck at FPS but i can usually get 1 kill per half hour of play, nope, not even close, i died 13 times before my game timed out, i think it timed out... i'm half thinking that i was kicked for \"feeding\" not sure.Reason No2 (my most prominent issue with this game): This issue was in the damn Tutorial. I was told to destroy some explosives with a pack of C4,I thought, \"Sure no problem, you mean this box over here that clearly has explosives on it?\" *dies* \"... was that not it? let me look around for something else then...\" *10 mins later* \"there is literally nothing else that even remotely resembles explosives, this has to be it...\" *dies* \"am i doing it wrong? am i too close? i'll stand further away and put it right on top of it then...\" *dies* \"i can't stand any further away!\" at this point i got angry and decided to throw the C4 willynilly all over in the hopes of getting lucky.(announcer guy): \"alright now that that's done.\" (me) \"i'm sorry... what? you wanted me to... throw the C4, over this wall, with no indication that the thing i need to blow up is there?\"Now i'm fully aware that i may be an idiot and i just didn't hear him say it was there, so i waited for my friend who was playing the tutorial at the same time as me to get to that point, so i could check that it wasn't just me... but no, we were given no indication of where to find the thing we were supposed to blow up.Yes i know two reasons isn't really enough to judge a game, but i judge a game on playability and how easy it is to learn to play, the tutorial other than that part was sub-par at best and we had instances of random glitching into places we weren't supposed to be in, like the railing the instructor stands on, which we had to clip out of.Now take from this review what you will, it's my personal experience with the game and my personal feelings towards it, the positive reviews out weigh the negative so maybe i was really unlucky.\n",

      "This game is very worth buying for only $20 in fact it is the best Alpha i have played in a long time :) the only down side of this game is that there are a stupid amount of hackers who will just take away hours, days even weeks of work. If you look on my rust photos that ive been bothered taking you'll see what im talking about!!! >:( But a good way to deal with this is to join a friend that knows if there are hackers on their server or a better way join a youtuber's server becasue they are the ones that really care.

One of the best features about GMOD is the addon feature where you can add anything, this can bring in new items, gamemodes, player models, and NPC's.

It has changed so much since 2013 and many people may complain that we're proceeding into complex gmaeplay too fast and possibly too soon. Although, the update for a more complex gameplay is what makes the game we know today after 2 years of it's development and it still goes strong today.pros:-\"SPAEC!!!\"-crash landings-endless possibilities (not literally, but possibly)-more chances of dying from being a dingus-still contains its previous aspects before the big updatecons:-none that I know of so far (unless people complaining about its new complex system counts)Overall, it is still a great game to goof around with your friends along with more possible role play scenarios (if you guys are into that stuff) and even though this has been one huge step-up, it is still the game we know and love to enjoy.\n",

It has very nice character customisation so you can create your very own warrior just how you like him or her to be with a skill tree to choose perks from the size of Russia.This game has greatly improved since the beta and has a nice storyline with multiplayer aspects to it.

      "Black Mesa is a great game, I played through the mod many times and I bought this version mainly for the multiplayer, which did not disappoint.The multiplayer currently only has the deathmatch and team deathmatch gamemodes, but they're both a lot of fun. Deathmatch is just chaotic killing and I'm sure team deathmatch is a lot better with friends than it is on your own. The maps are full of detail, being big enough to survive and find a weapon, but not too big that you're isolated from the action. It's a shame there are only two gamemodes, but I feel the quality and quantity of the maps make up for that, and I'm looking forward to when they do add different gamemodes in the future.The singleplayer is better than it was in the mod, there are several significant changes; the new sounds and models are great, the general look is better with various subtle changes, and some major ones too. Even though the game is unfinished, it still has a lot of replay value to it. I've played the mod excessively, yet I'm sure I'll play this newer version many times until the game is completed. So far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs, the game crashed several times when I first started and there have been a few dodgy textures floating around but they are not frequent enough to be annoying.Overall, I would recommend this game. It is reasonably priced by today's standards, and there is a lot to do in both the single and the multiplayer, even being unfinished.\n",

      "Después de tantas horas que pase en este juego, mi opinión sobre el juego es… NEGATIVALas cosas negativas de este juego son: -Partidas desbalanceadas -Casi todas las partidas están llenas de hacker  (y lo peor es que no hay manera de reportar)-Poca originalidad del juego (básicamente es una copia mediocre del RO2 y Battlefield)-El juego esta lleno de bugs-El famoso “Pay2Win” -Se puede decir que también este juego es muy Pro-Alemán. Solo a los alemanes les dan buenas cosas, mientras que a los demás puras ♥♥♥♥♥♥s nerfeadas . De lejos uno de los peores juegos de la 2GM que he jugado.  Lo mas triste es que cuando lo empecé a jugar por primera vez (Por el 2014 creo) se veía que era un juego prometedor, y que tenia futuro, pero tras pasar los años, uno se da cuenta de que la compañía del juego “Reto” es bastante incompetente . Realmente no lo recomiendo, solo pasaras malos ratos sufriendo por partidas desbalanceadas, Hackers, bugs masivos y un contenido mediocre que el juego te ofrece. Pésima experiencia de juegoSi quieres jugar un buen juego de la 2GM, juega RO2, Mil veces mejor que esta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ de juego.\n",

      "DayZ is probably one of the most played open-world Zombie games to date. It was one of the most successful mods in history, and although the standalone isn't looking so crash-hot now, it's definetely headed in the right direction. My advice would be to buy this game right now, even if your not really happy with the current build.I only say this because the difference between the mod and this game is vastly different, and as such the developers are trying to take this in a more realistic direction. This won'tbe agreeable to everyone, of course, and sometimes I think they've taken it too far, and retracted from the game's appeal. Despite what I know they're aiming for, I think they have to consider that this is JUST a game, and shouldn't be crafted to a point where the community no longer enjoys it.

      "I've really enjoyed Insurgency; purchased it recently for myself and friends as a Christmas present with the Steam sale.One of those friends described it as \"very intense\", I'd have to agree. It seems pretty realistic for a game. It reminded me of an updated \"America's Army\" game, which had the same realistic 1-3 bullets and you're dead mechanic. And that's a good thing, if you like some realism. It reminds me a little of paintball, except better accuracy and with real weapons. The \"suppression\" feature is really cool, and reminds me of the effect that paintballs whizzing around your head has.I much prefer it to the various CS as the recoil/bullet spreading seems more realistic, and the loadouts are not related to success in the game. It's just a fixed budget of points and weight, to distribute how you see fit. This makes it more newbie-fair. The allocation of members of your team into a fixed breakdown of pickable roles is good because it prevents an accumulation of snipers on teams. Often the \"Support\" or \"Machinegunner\" role goes unused, which suits me as I enjoy playing it. Once you get the bipod setup lying prone, behind some concealment or cover, it's a lot of fun because the recoil is gone and you can suppress or kill. It suits a somewhat older gamer like me with slower reaction times, because as you fire you are suppressing and then you can eventually hone in and mow them down. Heavy armor often extends your life a bit.Speaking of concealment vs cover, that is definitely something you learn to adapt to. It's a lot of fun shooting through some corrugated iron or wooden boxes, especially with AP bullets, to kill someone crouching behind them.The emphasis on achieving objectives to win, points for taking objectives and killing opposition at the objective instead of just raw K/D ratio makes for a great teamwork environment. If you snipe, you snipe to capture the objective (countersniping or covering the objective). It's really fun with good teamwork, especially if someone who knows  what they are doing is instructing players what to do and boosting morale.I don't even notice that the engine is supposedly old, at least it was inexpensive and ran on my machine. Looks good enough compared to old games I am familiar with.\n",
      "Fun game to play by yourself, but so much better with a friend/s. i recommend this game to everyone. i'v personally played just over 100 hours and i don't regret a thing. Also the shiftcodes are a cool feature (you basically get free loot).\n",

      "Best Game ever to play with friends\n",
      "First time I saw this game was on one of Rooster Teeth's show called \"PlayPals\" with Michael and Gavinhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzDyIjLtQO8The whole gameplay and design really caught my attention. Infact, the gameplay really reminds me of Journey (which is another game I love heaps).So as soon as Frima Studios announced that the game was released on Steam I knew I would be buying it straight away. But, I saw that steam recommend that you play this game with a controller...unfortunately, I don't own one. Eventually, I brought the game and decided to try playing the game using the keyboard. At first it can be quite difficult to but I say within 30-45 mins you'll get the hang of it and will be fine with it. I have been playing as a single player which is still fine and great but I do recommend playing this game with a friend, buddy, pal etc. You'll have tons of fun as there seems to be alot of levels.\n",
      "I am yet to find a more realistic shooter on the market, this game offers tremendous entertainment. Conduct multiplayer operations online or with friends, or play special operations missions in the singleplayer mode with massive upgrades from the previous installment of the series. I don't recomend the game, buy it. Now.\n",
      "Amazing game, the realism of it makes for a more, well i guess realistic experience! The only problem I have experienced is I can never seem to join my friends games...\n",
      "Unturned is an entertaining game, Here give my opinion of the game: Unturned is a survival game like Day Z, because you're a guy you have to build your house and collect things for their survival and the cities are infected zombies. you need food, drinks and antibiotics to reduce the detoxification (detoxification increases when hit by a zombie). The game is fun to play in multiplayer, because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies. when I started to survive in the game, I thought it would be a game like rust, minecraft, terraria, etc.. but I found it different, there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive, from when you start to when you finish, the path between the two is as much fun in this game. Never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed. the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta, the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher. Keep updating unturned, having a good life.\n",
      "Good game, well made by The Behemoth along with Battleblock Theatre. Might get a bit repetitive at times, making it boring. Best played with friends to make it a more intresting experience. Could improve on the online play. 7.5/10 Recommended playing this game.\n",
      "This is a title you and all your friends should have in your steam library!!!Even though Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Thrill Pack was released way back in 2002, you will have an amazing experience playing this witnessing one of PC's greatest releases.

      "Sepia Tears is a F2P Visual Novel which has a rather romantic plot structure to it. The story is perhaps one of the best I have seen in while, at most times remaining cryptic and mysterious until the final part of the game came around. Now not giving much away about the ending but I personally found it very satisfying and the build up really made you emotionally invested in the protagonist so it made the ending that much more impacful. The game takes around 4-5 hours to complete depending on how fast you read and what choices you make. Now I have only played through this once and got the good ending, but I am assuming there are some other (worse?) ones (When I play a VN that is heavy in the feels, I tend not to even look up nor play the bad endings). Overall this game has a solid story, a solid soundtrack, and solid artwork, A must play for any visual novel fan, and hey its free (which is actually rather suprising for a game this refined).Verdict: 7.5/10Now please excuse me as I take heat from all the people on my friends list calling me a weaboo for playing anything that remotely contains anime.\n",

      "I started near a lighthouse suddenly all i could hear were bullets wizzing past me, I sprinted away from were they sounded like they were coming from. Then I see two guys running towards me shouting friendly they had no gear, I shouted friendly back they said they were going to meet up with there friend so we run along the coast and stop at some buildings to loot. I found a pistol and a orange saloon backpack i stuff my pistol in it and pray they didn't see we kept running, one guy fell behind so I go back and put a bullet in his head. and screamed shots after I looted him, he had beans..... I just tried to catch up but I couldn't but i just followed until he stopped and then he just fell to the ground.Then i heard more bullets there were six bandits just firing at will, i run behind the trees and go prone and then I shot backbut i heard a clicking noise and realized i was out of ammo i keep sprinting along the coast until i find a village and there is a splitting axe in the shed. i sprint back knowing this was a bad idea but i charge the tree line and scream I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE BANDITS i hit one of them twice he falls to the grong but hes still talking then i realize they were all pointing there guns at me 1 pulled out handcuffs and said \"stay still for me\" I wasscared to death because i know what bandits to to people in this game he got the axe and finished offthe bandit on the floor for some reason and started punching me and feeding me rotten food and disinfectant i want to log off but i will be stuck hear for ever so i just let them do what they do then suddenly shots i looked at the bandits they weren't shooting they were getting shot i shout friendly over and over the guys shooting the bandits must have been bandits because after they were dead i was to.

      "I hate Dota 2, this game is one of the most addictive out there but you will come to hate it. I still play this game and love it but one can not simply sit down and play a game of Dota without being constantly flamed for every single thing your teammates can think of. In other words the community is disgusting. Do not expect to be forgiven for anything but if you really can put in the hours to get decent at the game it is worth it. But please, watch some videos and learn a little bit before you play for the first time. If you dont and just dive in it will most certainly not be fun for you.On a better note though this game has an amazingly high skillcap which I am nowhere near at my lowly 2k mmr and you will keep wanting to come back and keep playing to hone your skills at every single hero in the game in a variety of roles. It does however make it so much easier to have a friend teach you some basics before you dive in at the deep end. Dota takes quite a while before you really start having a lot of fun but nce you do you will never go back, great to play both with friends as well as by yourself this game is bloody awesome. you will just have to put up with the community.\n",
      "F*ck this game is beautiful. Sure it looks like another strat but the amount of detail brought into the games is mind blowing.

      "This game, can be good at times, don't get me wrong. It can also be enjoyable, and playing with friends is great too, but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed. For example, for some reason (and not just me) when ever your ping starts to f*ck up, so does your fps, you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 (like me) and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag, before you realise, nope its your computer. I know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem. That's not the only problem, for some reason, i had these HUGE LIGHTS that were apearing out of no where, and almost making me blind. The PC Au servers, are also, terrible (at least there dedicated this time) but still bad, you can one round have the best ping, and then next, awful ping, and my internet isn't even that bad (and i have australian internet ahha). The games killing system and aiming could also be improved... *doesn't help that im not that good of an aim ahah* but still after playing CS:GO for example, i can be doing well in that, and finding that when i get killed its \"oh okay, fair enough\" and when i get a kill \"well that was good\" in BO3, its like when you get killed \"OMG WHAT THE F*CK, HES HACKING OMG THATS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T\" and when you get a kill \"no way i got that?\" and thats just a few things to name. It's also very buggy, and you can tell that it has been rushed, either that or its just a bad console peasent to PC port. I had high hopes for this game, and im not impressed, at all. I did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable, and is most likely keeping me from refunding it, its just MP need's to be improved ALOT. Cheers\n",

You also have to manage your income because if you and your team are doing realy bad you may not be able to aford a gun. The knifes are sooo expensive even though you use your primary and secondary wepons more, someknifes are worth $2,000 which ridiculas and if some one buys that insted of a good pc than there plain stupid.

      "Planetside 2 is an MMO FPS RPG, and one of the first of it's kind. It was developed by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE), a well known game development company behind MMOs such as Everquest, DC Universe, and the original Planetside. As it's name suggests, it takes place in humanity's future on the faraway planet of Auraxis.Three powerful factions: the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate, and Vanu Sovereignty, slug it out to control as much territory and resources as possible. You fight on 4 unique continents (large maps), where huge, often awesome battles with infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft occur. Planetside 2 is a game to be played with a squad or platoon of friends, as playing lone wolf can be difficult, repetitive, and at times, boring.In organised outfits (clans), though, the game can create great memories. It requires a decent computer, and it's detailed large-scale environments and battles can take down the fps on cheaper rigs. I'm going to give Planetside 2 an 8 out of 10.\n",
      "DayZ is a zombie/survival game that was first known in the ArmA2 mods. It became a very mod and alot of people enjoyed it. In this DayZ Standalone game, you'll encounter alot of things that made you go \"WTF?\" For an example when your inside a house/building, most of the time the zombies somehow go through the floors and walls of the house and inmanged to hit you and make you bleed to death. One of the other things that makes it bad, is some consumbles such as clothes (mostly) and food are floating above the ground/flooring and you can't pick them up. I honesty can't fully judge on the game that it's still under developing, but what I can say is it feels more realistic the way you die like hunger, thrist, bleeding to death and poisoning. When you get soaked from rain or pond, you'll move slower than normal, which it makes it harder to outrun the zombies. On a positive note, I'll definitely recommend to play/buy the game and have fun with friends and become zombie slayers!7/10\n",
      "Wow.... sooooo much to say about this game. Where to start. well for starters, no matter how many other better games you find on steam, Skyrim, The Witcher Wild hunt ANY OTHER GAME! you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will terraria. You will never beat the classics such as minecraft, no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore...... but tbh TERRARIA is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!! you think the producers of minecraft have it hard, OF COURSE THEY DO!! its a 3D game, everythings difficult. even tho Terraria is a 2D game it has so much more content including bosses, weapons, biomes, enemies, items, NPC's, tools, ores and A LOT MORE!!! like srrsly you think or minecraft, then think of everything is has. terraria has it but about 5 times more. ESPECIALLY items, terraria has like..... 50 times more items then minecraft. Minecraft just simply cant compete. with terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword, pickaxe and an axe. You find a tree, chop it down, make a house, make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench, some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons, look at wiki or do it yourself. spawn an easy boss and DESTROY!!! it with the AMAZING new weapons you have scavenged and made. collect its drops to save up copper, silver, gold, platnium coins to buy unique items from NPC's such as, awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining. and just when you think its over a meteor lands, you go find its location, (attempt to) mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads, use the meteor armor, weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold. once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons, get better weapons to go aaaallllllll the way down to the underworld (A.K.A HELL!! XD) to mine some hellstone! make a giant pathway thought the underworld, kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll, drop it in lava and summon the WALL OF FLESH with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game.... (killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode) harder enemies, new bosses, destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops, which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine....... ANYWAY i HIGHLY recommend buying this game.

      "Garry's Mod is one of the best games I have. This game is very very addicting and fun to play. If you don't have get it NOW. All the gamemodes are very fun and a great game to play with friends.\n",
      "Tera is like eating your favorite food. The more you eat it the more you get tired of it and it tastes better with friends around.So I'd give it a 7.9/10\n",
      "This game is still in early beta but it is so much fun espicially with friends and is a hole lot better than Terraria.\n",
      "this is a game that you should put to SHAME. when your friends play this over other games...SHAME. when they spend real money on this....SHAME when they even speak of the name.....SHAME.Planetside 2 is SHAME to what it use to be....SHAMEThis is a waste of life...a waste of data....a waste of space which makes me want to SHAME it.\n",
      "Es un juego divertidismo, bastante dificil de aprender a jugar.No hay mucha gente activa, pero normalmente cuando entras en un server, al tiempo aparece gente.No vengas a creer que sabes jugar solo por TF2, porque estas muuy lejos de casa.MUUUUUY lejos, hay mucha mas movilidad y muchas formas de moverse (bunny hop, corriendo normal, caminando, usando las concussion... o cualquier explosion :v), ademas de las diferencias entre los personajes mucho mas visibles que las del TF2.Lo malo es que no hay VAC ni nada, por lo que siempre hay gente molesta o solo hackers, wallhackers, etc.La verdad, en el poco tiempo que jugue, me diverti muchisimo. Sin contar que se puede jugar con amigos (Pero solo en servers publicos).A veces es bastante... estresante para los que se toman en serio los juegos... Como yo :v. Ya que te matan con granadas que no viste nunca, o solo viene un soldier y te vuela todo al carajo.Pero de vez en cuando aparecen los friendly y se puede pendejear con los objetos y items.}Con el tema del ping, a mi me anda bien siempre, y eso que tengo una pc dentro de todo, familiar... solo con lo basico. En todo el tiempo que jugue no vi ni una sombra de lag, bugs ni nada de eso... bueno, algun que otro bug con las texturas o los efectos del entorno o de las armas, pero eso es divertido de ver. Si es que no me equivoco y es un \"mod\" hecho por la comunidad, la verdad debo aplaudir a quienes hicieron tan bien este juego.Pido perdon por mis faltas de ortografia (los tildes, acentos, como se llamen)Yo le doy un 8/10, teniendo en cuenta la falta de sistema anti hackers y el hecho de no poder hacer un sv para jugar con amigos.\n",
      "Of course, the graphics are kind of dated right here and the gameplay is repetitive, but the fun is where you teamed up with your friends to survive this so-called zombie apocalypse. To kill or to be killed is all on your hands.\n",
      "One of my favorite games of the year. really fun and addidting to play with friends.\n",
      "This game is the amazing for anyone looking for a realistic tactical shooter. Everything about it is designed to make it as realistic as a computer game can be. It's still a relatively new game but it's getting better with every update. There are always plenty of games to join and the community is always friendly. Even if you are new there are plenty of people willing to help you out rather than criticize you. 8.5/10\n",
      "Realm of the Mad God is legit one of the best games I have ever played! I'm surprised an 8-bit MMORPG is F2P!!! Realm of the Mad God requires just 2 things. To install and play for the rest of your life. This game is one of my favorite games especially with friends. Whenever I get bored, I play this game and I get hooked on it for a ♥♥♥♥ amount of time (I bring my Laptop with me to lunch and dinner). I love the fact that the creators on this game have made it free to play like that is what makes me happy. I also love the fact you can work together and fight extremely hard bosses. You work your way up to fight Oryx the Mad God! This game is great and recommend playing. Its only like 18 mb so its pretty small for a great game. I'm giving this game a 11/10. Love it entirely, love everything about this game.\n",
      "Ez Pz Lemon Squeezy, Single Player so indept and brings out the colours of this truly spectacular game. Such great multiplayer experience with the co-op. I loved the way you can get with your friends take a journey and slay dragons while turning your friends into frogs. -3/10\n",
      "All mods from half life have become a standalone game (The Stanley Parapables, This game, ect) and they all have been great and Garry's Mod is no exception with your Gravity Gun and Physics Gun from Half Life 2 and the Tool Gun you can make a rocket propelled bathtub, a nuclear powered wheel chair and so much more. This game has a great Single Player mode giving you time to make amazing creation without the harasment of others. Multiplayer is great, playing with friends or with random people and its always different! I recommend this game to everyone, but to get the full experience you will need to pay a bit extra to get games that add more (Counter Strike Source, Half Life 2, ect) but it is worth it in the end by adding more gamemodes like TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) by getting Counter Strike Source. Defidently get this game (With Counter Strike Source). 10/10\n",
      "My hours. help.I wrote something for real!These hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. I believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 2+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!Although in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.One last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. Just give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun\n",
      "The game is really good but when you are in the game for some time most of the terrain gets destroys making it harder to play and sneak around which also leads you to fall down holes, also when you snipe it makes a laser when you scope.The game however is very creative and allows you to create your own maps which is very hard but also fun because you can then make it together with your friends.\n",
      "Great game...Great story but it addicts you alot so the story should be longer....try to start of with your friends and ghosting make it even more fun\n",
      "An incredible game. Garry's mod isn't just a sandbox, it's a first-person shooter, a zombie survival, an obsticle coarse, a war-zone- if you can think of it than it's there. Personally i don't like sandboxes but this games is everything you could possibly imagine. You can kill your friends, make new friends and kill those friends too. You're only limited by your own imagination. The possibilities are endless.\n",
      "When i fist saw this game on steam I wasent going to get it because I thought it would just be waste of space on my computer but when i saw that my friend had it I tryed it out At his house and now you cant get me off it:) Im giving it a 8.5/10\n",

      "This review is for the rust communityIt all started when i met someone call well lets say bob because name discloseure is bad.Bob had a naked friend beside him called Nick Bob came into my house and gave me some wood i was happy, i had a new neighbour (Nick) friend (bob) and my housemate (Leo) Leo went away for a while and more of my friends started playing with me ,Connor ,Jordan ,Riley we  helped Bob raid a Place there was a storm though so we blacked out and after the raid everyone was gone so we head back home. that night Bob and his clan leader Alan came by they tried to break into nicks base, i ignored them and went to sleep the next day me and my friends got raided all was lost, we lost 1000+ metal fragments heaps of wood, guns and our front door, we were really sad and it said we got killed by Rusty we checked bobs profile and under other name it said rusty we blamed it on their clan we built another base got guns and made some allies named captain C and Captain B they were pirates the yhelped us attack the clans base but some idiot dropped the explosives and didnt pick them back up so we ran i killed one and my friends died captain C was already at our base so i told him the code when i got back he was chillin and he said he was going to go get more explosives, in fact he stole 150 high quality metal but we were cool (sorta) and we gathered supplies some guys tried to raid us in the night and our neighbor did to then the chopper came and blew up our roof so i fixed it and i got all the important stuff and slept outside then i got eaten by a wolf.F*ck WolvesThen i started Playing rust it was pretty great.\n",

      "Things i put into CS:GO -- Money- Time- Effort - SkillCounter Strike, if your not a cod player is for most people the all round best game franchise. You cant really complain with CS:GO's amazing graphics, SKINS, teams, ranks and high skill cap. Until skins game out on CS:GO, or i atleast found out about Em' i was never interested in the competitive aspect of it and just played for fun. Soon after I started finding out about Blue gem case hardeneds, slaughter patterns or the later found dopplers and this intrigued me. I started my CS:GO life of as a Silver II as my first rank. As i started working my way up the ranks, fighting to get past red handed hackers and blue handed smurfs i found many friend that are on a daily basis influential to me. Whether it be a school friend, someone who lives close to me or someone that lives half the world away from me i kept finding myself in banterific relationships with all sorts or people from everywhereBest game if ever played ,                                 LuX\n",
      "It is one of my all time favourite games. i find it very fun playing with your friends or on your own. P.S you should get it.\n",
      "Well, maybe this not have the best qualities. Maybe this is not \"perfect\". Maybe this is not completely f2p. But, i play with a couple of friends and we laugh while play this game. Flying corpses, guys with rocket launchers, headshots, campers, building guys who build his own base to camp. This game is TERRIBLE, but it's funny, and i like that.\n",
      "There seem to be a lot of negative reviews of this game, so let me put in my two cents.When I first saw this game in the steam store it looked like a wallrunning ninja tps hybrid. And when I downloaded and played it, that is exactly what I received.I was also pleasantly surprised by the 4player Co-op option and the the campaign doesn't start off fantastic I hear it gets fairly good, and playing with three friends always makes things more fun.The game also has pay to win and MMO elements;MMO elements like friends lists, PMs, and the option to make a clan, add something nice to the game.I found the \"pay to win\"esque nature of the game wasn't a deal breaker for me, because it's more like \"pay to advance faster\". Without paying a single cent you can exceed at the game by skill alone easily.The other thing is game progression, meaning players who have spent longer on the game will have better gear than you, and a few extra abilities.However, this does not put them at an extreme advantage, and is balanced nicely.On my first game I was able to get a nice amount of frags even though I was a beginner.In terms of gear, the best gear is only slightly better than the defalut stuff, with upgrades being slight. This means that no matter what, you still need skill to win, not money. A player with the best gear will still easily be poned by a more skilled player.I think this game s a lot of fun because of the ninja like elements to it with the wall running, the variance in the classes, and because of a lot of the unique gameplay aspects in it. Being able to switch weapons quickly means that a lot of the time you will be most efficient in using your entire aresenal agains an opponent, like switching from close range to mid range quickly to retreat from a flamethrower, or as a sniper dashing back quickly from an approaching assailant with a sword, to then quickly pull out your own sword and dash forward to catch them off guard. I like that you can use weapons while dashing and wallrunning, meaning I can dash sideways to avoid a sniper, and then quickly run across the wall towards him firing my SMG while jumping from wall to wall to avoid his fire, then dash to the side onto a pillar, then change to my sword while running in a spiral around that pillar so he can't keep track of me, then dash behind him and finish him off with the sword.There are breast physics as some have so crudely fixated on, but unless you are swinging around character models in the lobby, they don't distract from gameplay. Also when characters with skirts die sometimes, they ragdoll into some compromising positions, but again, it's easy to either ingore or fixate on, depending on your attittude.So in short, I really love the gameplay.I love the way it blends long, mid, and closerange.I love how fast paced it is.I love the ability to form my own clan or get tegether a team line up with my friends and together wreak havoc online.I love fealing like a ninja when I drop off a chandelier to take down an unsuspecting enemy.I love the split second reactions in just the sword play alone, and I love that there is a whole gamemode dedicated to this.Personally, I recomend this game, it's fun and it's free.\n",
      "Amazing game! While Borderlands 2 has the edge on the first in terms of story and dynamics, Borderlands has some great aspects that the sequel lacks. The visuals and soundtrack combine for a realistic and unique atmosphere; while there are clever moments of humour littered throughout the game. One of the best parts is the multiplayer as you can play through the entire story (including side quests) with up to three friends. How cool, right?Would totally recommend!\n",
      "better with friends but still heaps of fun.\n",
      "If you have three willing friends, thank god and then all get the game.If you have two willing friends pray to god that one of them dosen't leave a quater of the way through your journey,*ben*, then get this game.If you have atleast one willing friend, devote your life to god and get this game.It is one of the best games I have ever played.Also if you don't have any friends i'm sure you will have some fun.\n",
      "This game is freaking awsome,it like Battelfield 2142 but with Massively Multiplayer and it better.The game like real-life war,it very easy to die in the battlefield and friendly fire always on.Even my favorite class is Sniper but it extremely difficult to kill a target.Also this game is great for everyone like to explode the world.This is the best teamwork game ever.But that was the good part now here the bad one.It hard to get money in a ridiculous way,everyday i play Planetside 2,it just give me like 10-30 Cert.But meanwhile the money needed to buy a weapon was like 10k-20k,i was like WTF???.And if you want to get more money is to become a memeber,but it like 2 months for 1$ according to my memories.Well that it for a Vietnamese 13 years old boy so overall i recommend this game.Well done Mr.Planetside 2 hope you will have more greater update in the future.Thanks you\n",
      "Assassins Creed II is a great game with a gripping storyline and exellent mechanics that really do make you feel like a classic awesome assassin. This game is so much fun to play. The game has the ability to grab you and take you into a world full of assassins and betrayal. This game is excellent but there are a couple of downsides. The tutorials are next to pointless. It is impossible to instantly know which button to press when it tells you to because they don't tell you which key to press, just a symbol representing it, which I found irritating and pointless. I also believe that this game really should've included Steam achievments and trading cards. There is something about some games that when you complete a difficult challenge or play for a couple of hours you feel you deserver some sort of reward to sow your friends your acomplishments. But maybe that's just me. Apart from these setbacks, I am thoroughly enjoying this game and I cannot wait to find out what happens next.\n",
      "OMG! Saints Row the Third is crazy awesome. This game makes old homeless people going on a d*ldo bat rampage completely normal. In Saints Row, you almost have the ability to do whatever you want. Whether thats jumping off a skyscraper naked, beating up a cop with a d*ldo, or just trolling your friends in online co-op!This game is absolutely amazing!\n",
      "A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. The best thing about Arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server. One of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is Atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode. I played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game, most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend!\n",
      "Tons 'O' fun, a great game and even more fun when playing with friends. definently recomended\n",
      "its a game for pepole how like to build have fun play with friends and fight aganst the worst of bosses and monsters\n",
      "It is evident from the start that this game is only intended to be played online. Ideally, a game should be a perfectly good standalone with an online option for later once you've completed everything else and have become bored. This is the opposite. A multiplayer with a single player tacked on as an afterthought. Ignoring the poor graphics and general design reminiscent of Postal 2 and similar games which were never intended to be taken seriously, the design of the AI in this game is appaling. By far the worst I've ever seen. Not only the enemy AI but your own team. No attempt was made to make the team anything more than backup muscle. Team members can't be ordered to hold/attack positions or execute objectives. They follow you around stupidly and shoot at things which happen to stand directly in front of them, not even noticing when they are being repeatedly shot. The enemy AI is similarly stupid not noticing things in plain sight but they have the advantage of clipping through you and your team to get behind you very quickly. So there's that. Not to mention overwhelming force.Granted the game is designed to hold off violent confrontation as long as possible but with the AI the way it is, this is impossible. Playing offline will guarantee police arriving within a minute and that would lead one to hope that the gunplay mechanics are at least decent. They are not. Besides the lack of reticle (which, ok I can live with but is odd given the hit confirmation reticle) the aiming moving and shooting are all pretty bad. Nothing horrendously wrong, but poor all round.On the issue of weapons however, it is impossible to pick up weapons from fallen cops and it's obvious that in order to enjoy a decent range of weapons you basically need to get the DLC. Now I have a $20 limit on games and this is NOT about to convince me to break that limit any time soon and with the current discounts I can justify some of the DLC which would allow me to make the game at least presentable. Wanting players to join the steam fanpage in order to unlock a bunch of basic gear is I feel rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a pretty low tactic to force people to be exposed to your promotions in exchange for making the one game they did buy semi-playable. A very DLC based experience and as such, a poor game.As for the levels, they're the same. I'll be doing a different job and running through the building on autopilot because I've seen it before except that the safe is in a different location now.And why does it keep updating? It feels like every time I start the game it needs to do an update. Games should never be updated, make an optional patch, and distribute bugfixes ASAP but any major overhauls save for the sequel.All in all, I'm hoping that once I play multipler with friends (the only reason I was told to get the game) it'll become somewhat good, but as far as going it solo to try and build up those skill points goes, it is a painful painful experience, not even worth the bandwidth to download the base game imho.\n",
      "TL;DR below10 minutes in and I was bored, 30 minutes in and I was hooked.Hard Reset is no more or less than the quintessential old school shooter. It lacks any real form of cover, leaning, and most shockingly crouch, and the maps are incredibly linear. There's no notion of stealth or sniping or any serious problem solving. It's a very spam-y game. You just take on waves of enemies as they come. There are different sorts of enemies, but it doesn't matter much in terms of just sinking enough ammo into them until they die. Enemies drop four kinds of drops: health (green), rifle ammo (red), plasma gun ammo (blue), and nano (orange). You also have a shield but it regenerates automatically. You collect enough nano and you earn an upgrade. Both of your weapons as well as your general gear upgrade the same way. Everything has 5 modes (the last two of which get unlocked later) and each mode has 2 additional upgrades beyond the first for a total of 15 upgrades for each weapon and your gear. For weapons this tends to mean a primary attack, and secondary function or attack, and a passive bonus in each of the 5 modes. Each weapon uses the same ammunition for each attack and each mode, albeit at different rates.Your environment is pretty dangerous, there are high explosives all over the place as well as electrified items which, when damaged, shock everything within range for a period of time before exploding. Additional from time to time you encounter random flame-throwers in the walls. You can take down entire waves of enemies with just the explosive and electric death traps lying around.That's basically it. That's the entire game (as far as I've played it anyway).On the down-side, the gun play isn't all that imaginative and you don't always have time to swap to all your cool new upgrades in the heat of battle. This combined with the high linearity, wave format of enemy encounters, terrible terrible voice acting and story (not that it has any real impact on the game), and the fact that, despite what the pictures look like above, the artistic style really isn't all that nice, makes me sort of sigh and dream of what this game could have been.IMHO, what this game could have been is Shadow Warrior (Redux), which I believe was a perfect and shining example of what happens when you put modern game technology and philosophy into an old school shooter. In a sense, Hard Reset is like a poor man's Shadow Warrior. Definitely not worth the same amount of money (I just picked up Hard Reset for like 2.50 USD, sooo not complaining). On the upside though, if you do like your old school shooters, this is a good game. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun, it's destructive, it's fast paced (during combat sequences), and you can just go insane. Ammo conservation hasn't been a problem yet (normal difficulty). Over all, I haven't found the game to be really difficult at all, which is not to say that I haven't died yet. Bottom line is, I'm enjoying it, I'd recommend it, and though I haven't played it enough to comment on the complaints about its short length, I'd say even at full cost (15 USD) I think it's fair.TL;DR : Solid game, proper old school shooter experience, no major faults besides ♥♥♥♥ story and acting, but nothing mind blowing either. I'd recommend it to friends.\n",
      "An amazing game to play with your friends. The amount of things you can do in this game that will give you long-lasting enjoyment is endless!\n",
      "you can make guns now! but you need friend it's OK for what it is, blueprints for guns\n",
      "This is a great game. I personally like the splitscreen funtion. Me and my friends can play together now! Loads of fun.\n",
      "Really good game in general. Fun for playing with friends or alone, And maybe meet some new friends on it too!\n",
      "Pros: - Yelling simulator- You will get the hang of it if you play such games like the elder scrolls franchise- Beautiful graphics and atmosphere- Creative and funny dialogue from any character in the game (especially the classes in Deadliest Warrior)- Great music that fits so well for each setting of the game- Interesting objectives that makes you come back for more.Cons:- The game seems a bit laggy- The world seems so beautiful that some pcs or laptops can't handle it- Pings can expand extremely fast ( if your internet is crap )- Combat seems to be in the form of rock, paper, scissors ( especially being put in unwinnable situations as an archer )- Not enough cosmetics and hats :(Overall this game seems to be one of my favorite games in pc, but only if your internet is good. Just give it time to load up and when it picks up, you my friend are going to experience a game that really captures the medieval feel. And every gamers dream about fantasy battles as knights for being a hero ( or villain ) in a server.I love this game so muchI give it a 9.5/10\n",
      "Not worth it!! pointless game and it's pretty stupid go into a server and then die with in 5 mins into it because there's tons of trolls and hackers when you dont have nothing on you its like no one wants to be friendly or help out id rather play DayZ instead of having to pay to be better\n",
      "Great game altogether! The game has a great multiplayer experience. On one hand, there can be players who are kind and try to help you as much as possible, then on the other hand are the players who love stealing other peoples' items/materials etc, which can be very entertaining at times.Gathering materials can be quite frustrating at times, but once you achieve building a house, securing your area and establishing allies, the game gets very exciting.Raids are a great part of the game as well. I tend to partner up with friends and allies, grab as much C4 as possible, and raid every base in sight. Some bases may have few materials, but most of the time you'll find heavily fortified bases that have too many materials and weapons to count.To conclude, good game, buy now.\n",

      "This game is a very good starter to play if you want to get into the Tom Clancy's series. My friends and I downloaded this to give it a try, and all that I can say is that I was very impressed for a free shooter game. 8/10 would recommend.\n",
      "I recieved Nuclear Throne in a Humble Monthly bundle, and it is by far the game that has recieved the most playtime from the bundle. Nuclear Throne is a Rogue-lite twin stick shooter with an interesting progression system within your runs. Your selected mutant will be able to accumulate different mutations after each stage if you have collected enough radiation drops from enemies. There is a large variety of guns which I doubt I've done more than merely scratch the surface of. The core gameplay loop is very enjoyable and I will continue to put hours into this gem. I do however have a few gripes with the video choices within the game. The framerate is capped at 30. I have heard that this is a problem with gamemaker studio, not necassarily the devs though. Apparently when you create a project you have to explicitly choose a framerate for it to run at and later on requires a tonne of work to change. Perhaps the blame may lie with the devs on that one but frankly it's not a big issue for me becuase of the existing graphical quality of the game and it's not in first person. Also the game is played in a 4:3 window within a 16:9 interface. I think this is an odd design choice but hey- It hasn't affected the gameplay for me. I would also love a story mode for this game, it doesn't have to be 30 hour campign or anything but I think it would enhance the experience for me. I will ot however hold this against the devs.Overall - 9/10I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends and the few video oddities are overseeable. You are getting great value in this game.\n",
      "This game is really enjoyable to play with friends especially in Casual or death-match mode.this game, made me laugh  almost break my mouse whilst playing competitive but it was good fun\n",
      "Comes with one free table so you can compete against your family, friends, and the rest of the world! :)There are also a huge variety of themed tables available for purchase, with awesome sound and light effects; cool multi-tiered tables, mini-challenges and games; along with Steam leaderboards and achievements. At full price the tables are great value. On sale they are steal! I own several tables for this game on Steam, Android Tablet and my phone. Zen create superior contemporary pinball tables worth every dollar I've spent for access on multiple platforms. It's Pinball. Pinball is awesome. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as \"same old\" to us.This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.\n",
      "it would be good if it launched on my computer but i like it from what i have seen and played on friends computers\n",
      "It's good for £0.44 but the game itself isen't spectacular.It's probobly the third best tower game i have played but tower games aren't really what i play.If you like tower games pick the game up and you'll have picked up a bargain, my friend has completed all of this without closing the window once so you can see how enjoyable it is.Yet again if you like tower games then you are picking up a bargain\n",
      "If you downt own this game then you have problems this game is amazingly fun if that is a word but if you are gonna get it make shore that you got a friend to play with because its a lot more fun with friends\n",
      "so cool bought it for me and my friend and dame!!! its so fun and is really amazing.its so cool that you can build tepee's and even totem poles to make a tribe and hang out with your friends/or other people.if you want it i recomend it i havent played it much but its allready draged me in,+ its in alphur so even more cool/good stuff is coming\n",
      "Fantastic MMORPG.  Other reviews say it all.  Attractive, smooth gameplay.  Brilliant community full of friendly and helpful team players.  If you are female you WILL be treated equally - it's wonderful!  I look forward to a good many hours playing Guns of Icarus.Edit: Kudos to the developers for keeping connected to the GoI community and compensating players after promptly resolved server issues. :)\n",
      "Terraria is a fun game where the amount of things you can find, kill and make are almost endless. It can get a bit boring playing by yourself sometimes but with friends it makes the game 10X more better. One of my favorite things to do is go seaching underground for statues and bringing them back to my massive tree house I struggle to get up to myself. Great game 7/10\n",
      "I don't mind the graphics but this game is just another boring and generic MMO with SO MANY BUGS. This game is also fun and friendly but the vim system is annoying. It also has very boring combat. I played ranger and all it did was choose an enemy, shoot at enemy, run from enemy and repeat. 0/10\n",
      "THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME!There will always be people online and in my experience they're nice people with 2 being my friends.I love the maps, servers, gamemodes and the seemingly endless amount of achievements.The game has an amazing set of characters and actually has awesome lore behind it.There's multiple ways to win not only with different gamemodes but by knowing the map (finding good sniping positions). You must have a good strategy for this game [teamwork, switching between weapons (actually a very good strategy) etc.]. Or playing a class that you're just plain good at (e.g. I am the best with pyro amoung all the classes).I most definetly missed some but these are some of the reasons why Team Fortress 2 is a perfect game. 10/10*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*Wait a second, Team Fortress has 12 letters and 9 classes 12 - 9 = 3 and 3 is the first number of 3201, if you rearrange those numbers you can make what looks like a Half-Life 3 logo.HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED FOR THE YEAR 3201!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Like many Co-op games this is great with friends and terrible with random people. I will admit however after playing for a while random peoples is not as bad, but playing with friends is still way more fun.On the positive side, the game engine if very sound, excellent graphics, its fast paced and fun to play. It has multiple difficulty levels, ranging from seriously too easy to omg this is too hard. So just about eveyrone can enjoy it. None of the DLC is required to play the game, and if your friend has more DLC's than you easily play with them, its pretty slick how you can always play with your friends if everyone owns the base game.On the negative side, the game can be a bootfest with random people. I feel the developer could easiely do quite a bit to make it not so terrible and make it easier to meet like minded players if you're playing with freinds. that being i have meet cool people and all but that takes a bit of persistance. Additionally, while the game itself seems to be solid, theres an ongoing issue with the developer. Where the developer stated at multiple times there would never be microtransactions, and after pushing out wave after wave of not the best dlc, they added a micro tranaction system. Some people have an issue with this, some people feel they made amends, and some just do not care. Additonally the devs seem to lie and manipulate the community.This game gets regular updates. Some of the updates are great some of the updates not so much, Adding missions, weapons, characters, things to the game is great. The weapon rebalance, the manner in which weapon skins were added, adding improvements for people who bought an exclusive dlc thats no longer offered amoung other things were not so great. I like the regular updates, but I don't like having to drink regularly to be able handle the changes.This is a good game. So good I've bought the base game for multiple other people to get them into it. I however find it increasingly harder and harder to support the devs and regretable to get people into it. Also, since payday 3 is annouced, I'll probably choose not get into that after the mess the devs made in this game.\n",
      "Such a great game, i can't even describe the enjoyment i had in it, i recommend this game to everyone wants to get a great time and some funny friends, even though you'll meet some nerdy russians make sure to rekt them so hard, you'll have some fun while doing it.\n",

      "Ah Yes, CounterSalt : Go KillyourselfThe game where kicking derankers gets you a banThe game where being kicked by a 4 queue gets you a banThe game where you ♥♥♥♥ off your friends and they get bansThe game where you accidently knife your friend first round of comp ever and get a banThe game where the 7 days never endThe game where drinking bleach is the only way to playThe game where u get mad over the tiniest of thingsThe game is the reason why i contemplate suicide So in other words its perfect game for a person to play and become suicidal after 1 hr of gameplay\n",
      "amazing game but they have to fix co op multiplayer so only u and your friend play online without hamachi and all of that\n",
      "If you want a fun game to do whatever you want in, this is the game for you. I reccomend that you buy CS:S with this game, because otherwise many maps you play on or download will be missing textures. The game is insanly fun to play with friends and I will continue to play it until I find another game like it. The game runs very easily, as it is running on the hl2 engine (which is very old). A must have for your steam library, and I think that this game will continue to grow into the future, and will be continue to be modded for a very long time.\n",
      "I don't know why but I'm addicted to this game and can't stop playing it, so I will list the pros and cons and hopefully you will get it yourself.Pros- Alot of great content- You can get hours of playtime from it- If you don't like playing games by yourself you can play with friends- Controls are simpleCons- If you play with friends they can steal things- Some bosses are hard and you will die alot- Glitches- Takes a while to get started properlySo hopefully this helped you to see if you like the game or not but personally i think it is alot easier playing with other people. I rate this game 8.5/10\n",
      "Risk Of Rain is a brilliant platformer/rouge-lite, the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily I can switch from being under-powered to over-powered and then back again in split seconds. (mostly from getting too cocky when I have certain power-ups. :P) It's genuinely a hard game and I love it for that reason. The music is a selling point as well, sort of a rocky/electronic/ambient thing.The difficulty scales just right for me, it gives me a good 2-5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level, so I can do either a quick pick-up-and-play run or i could do a good 40 min run to (rarely) get to the last level. Plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power-up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone.The only gripe I have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends, when I want to connect with a friend I have to use a program called Evolve[evolvehq.com] that gives me and my friends a temp IP address, and even that fails some of the time.All in all, this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list.\n",
      "Fun game, cheap especially when on sale. Regular item drops. Only problem is players starting out will have a little trouble in the main online play as the majority of players are very experienced. Other than that, really fun to play on your own or with friends.\n",
      "Good game really fun 2 play with friends and FREE\n",
      "This game is SO FUN! There are so many weapons to choose from that have different effects. It's fun to go competitive and kill every person on the enemy team, but it's even more fun just to mess around with others!They're hats and misc items (clothes) to make your favourite class look the best out of everybody else. They can make you look like a real proffessional... sometimes.This is a brilliant game to play with friends (but not so much family =3)\n",

      "Ok so all my friends asked me to review this game but I don't want it be as long as the Borderlands 2 review. So let's use an IGN structure. The presentation of this game is amazing the characters, art style and music are all amazing. To be honest I think this is the 2nd best game Valve have ever produced and that is because of the detail, all the characters are balanced and holy fun to play as. Each Character is completely different letting you play the game in 9 different ways. Now about the trading aspect just look at mine and my friend Hugobosscat inventory and that should tell you about our opinion on the trading. So in a whole TF2 is one of the best games ever made and it's free.\n",
      "I love this game. I originally bought it because it was one of the few single player mac games around. Then I discovered multiplayer when I realised a few of my friends had it. This was more fun than you can imagine. Foolishly running around or being stealthy was fun either way. The fact that you work together instead of against each other (but there is a mode for that to) was awesome because it was never about who got the most coins it was just about getting all the coins. The level design is great and never gets boring, the music suits the game so well, and the characters have equally great abiities. Even in single player this game is great. I've owned it for about half a year and still have not completed all the levels. The storyline is sometimes laughable but always interesting. Imagine Hotline Miami had a child with Payday 2, thats Monaco in a nutshell.Easily a 10/10 if not more.\n",
      "I found this game so much fun when i first played it, But..... it aint that great of a game considering a big lack of content in the campaigns. marine starts pretty good same with alien but the predator campaign is the worst, they could have done soo much more with all of them and the last few levels are just unfun. I found most enjoyment from the campaigns out of loving the aliens movie and the universe. the multiplayer is where the game really shines in my opinion with alot of game modes to choose from and some pretty good maps, my favorite is survivor but with the 2 maps the game comes with its gonna get old pretty fast (without the dlc). grab some friends and have alot of fun but if they make a new one they have to stop blaming weyland yutani for EVERYTHING!!!! if you want a good multiplayer experience with really good graphics, excellent lighting, great sound and perfect atmosphere this is your game. 60%P.S new Marine futuristic design is awesome\n",

      "Arkham Origins - I love the Batman Games, but this game attracted me more than Arkham City and Asylum. I loved playing the story and the game's side missions. The story adds better boss fights (use of stealth this time in some bosses) and fun missions such as predator missions. The side missions have you foiling the plans of Edward Enigma, Bird, Penguin and other Batman villains. This time around Batman had multiplayer, which is a really good feature that I feel didn't get enough attention. This multiplayer has 2 players playing as hereos - Batman and Robin (With heaps of skins from your favourite Batman comics) and 6 other players split between either Bane or Joker thugs. These characters have firearms, traps, grenades and many other weaponry to take down the stealthy hunter (the hereos), these character are customisable aswell, changing their outfit, archytypes and accessories. I have heaps of fun playing with my friends online and think any player should expierence this. So please, do yourself a favour, and buy this game :)\n",
      "When I recieved this game I was hecka excited. I had finished this game on my friend's Xbox 360 only months before and enjoyed playing it with him in Co-op mode. After finshing this game on my PC I realised how boring and repetitive the game really was. The game is not a free-roaming or exploring type. It restricts you to the very bone with it's story levels, which are the only things that you can actually do in this game. Sure, myself being a huge Tolkien fan should enjoy this game a lot, but the lore is barely touched on. There are refrencing to the movies and books but no huge give away of what the game/story is actually about to all new-comers. If your looking for a Middle-Earth game with heaps of lore and factual basings on Tolkien's work, please, please buy Shadow of Mordor. I did so on my Xbox One, and have to say, it's probably one of my favourite games of all time.\n",
      "This game is for the fun and creative people of Steam who either want to mess around with sandbox or play with friends on the many different gamemodes and servers that are included in Garry's Mod.\n",
      "Really good game and fun to play with like friends. Its way better than cod because you actually need skill and strategy to win rather than mindlessly killing people in cod. 10/10\n",
      "This game is really fun to play with friends but to play it without raging you would need a fairly good computer and patience. The bugs in this game can be moderately bad to scare-the-living-daylights-out-of-you by teleporting zombies on you and them being able to walk through walls. I think in this game there should be a few more things to do, because now there are a lot more options such as cooking and such but otherwise it gets very lonely in the game. Random towns and areas that contain absolutely nothing are very disappointing and the noises of wire fences rattling and zombie moans can give you a heart attack. Given the fact that this game is Alpha and there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed to be able to play it with a lot of fun and enjoyment, it is a very good game and the set up of the towns and other villages etc are good for a game that you want to spend hours upon hours on. If you like running on a game for half an hour in reality to get to an airbase that you could get killed at and have to do it all over again, and lose your stuff, then this is the game for you.\n",
      "this game is very fun to play by yourself or with a couple of friends on the same server. i recommend garry's mod to people who are trying to find an entertaining game to play.\n",
      "Great Game!although this game is still in the ALPHA version its great, the potentional is their and you can see it.as this game progresses through its development I cant wait to see the end result.a must buy.by the way playing this game in squads with friends really makes the gameplay come to life.\n",
      " = It's a Zombie game. At least they aren't Nazis... /Senses incoming DLC./as holding my handgun upside down; AND backwards! D; What's up with that? You should also make sure that the if you get a certain style of melee weapon; they swing differently. Like; I don't think I'd swing an Axe like a Baseball bat. XD Just saying!\n",

      "i do not recommend this game its hard to play people f*** you up when your a Commando in Team Deathmatch and trying to fight but the Snipers are just pieces of CRAP! I do not want to buy this to a friend cause its garbage 5/10!\n",
      "Very fun when playing with friend's needs to be finished.\n",
      "It is a really fun game alone or with some friends. There are basically no limitations to this game so what are you waiting for? Go ahead and buy this magnificent game.\n",
      "We set out to hunt down the Nazi as a riflemen I bob my head up and insantly sniped, my friend runs in to clear the building and lives to kill the sniper. I walk in and instantly hit by a bazooka 10/10\n",

      "my friend bannd my other friend form game now he cant play game Rip kys kms\n",
      "A great and really well made game. I didn't really know what to expect when first playing and just moved around for a while before exiting the game. I then again played with friends and instantly it got better. I learnt the controls and actually had fun, it's a really well made game and is really fun to play if you bother to get past the boring learning bit. I hope the developers keep up this level of standard because if they do this game will really be a gem.\n",
      "This game is good and all... when you have friends, when you matchmake with randoms it is worse the someone sanding off the tip of your ♥♥♥♥♥, i would rater cut my balls off then play a game with people who cant open there eyes! and you cant even quit without getting a ban, but i dont care about the ban because atleast thats better then playeing with people who cant open there eyes.if you cant move a mouse properly, this is the game for you.\n",
      "This Game will test your reflexes and your patience. make sure that you come in expecting to fail nearly everytime. But that one time you win, You feel like a Boss but you were home and there were no friends for you to boast to. Well this game is great for everyone who just needs something to fill in time.\n",

      "Great multiplayer game, if you have friends that play it as there isn't that many people who play online. The best thing about this game is how fast you can go, up to insane, inhumane speeds (I don't know who anyone could go over 1000 and not instantly get hit) but this is still a really good game and I highly recommend you buy it as long as you have the skills to play.\n",
      "Imagine a function that everyone's invited to. It's all over social media and touted as the biggest event of the year.  You plan on going because all your friends and colleagues intend to, but days pass and you forget to RSVP. Your calendar stops functioning and you lose sight of all your big appointments. You press on regardless, making sure everything's ready prior to the big day as you frantically search for your invitation. Time goes by and you get distracted, forgetting about your plans and your schedule. You finally locate your invitation and head to the venue, only to find a fish and chip shop where a reception should be, and that the big event was held three years ago. That's how late I am to this party. Released in 2011, Bastion is a game that belies its indie origins, combining great gameplay with colourful art and an amazing soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, making for a complete package that puts some bug-ridden AAA games to shame. The haunting song that plays during the closing credits, Setting Sail, Coming Home, will likely remain in your head for days, along with the urge to keep playing. Bastion is a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. If, like me, the game has been languishing in your \"to-play\" list for a while, waste no more time. Play it now. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Okay, so this is what I think of Goat Simulator:I HAD AN AMAZING TIME running around as a goat and doing all sorts of crazy goat things. Unfortunately, the maingame novelty didn't last very long. Yes, I had a good laugh (and I don't even have a sense of humour) but the game surely needs more content or purpose or whatever it is. I don't like open worlds too much. I sort of created my own purpose by trying to find a way to glitch out of the map... but what can you expect? this is a SIMULATOR, not a game, and it was developed by Coffee Stain Studios as a joke and a parody of other simulator games on the market (Truck Simulator anyone?). Please keep this in mind if you are intending to purchase Goat Simulator.ONE THING TO MENTION though is that there is no online multiplayer. However, I think I read somewhere that they are working on it. If that comes to pass, then this will definitely be my new favourite game. This game so NEEDS multiplayer.THE MODS are probably the best thing about this game. Unfortunately there are not many fun mods that been created yet. There is a challenging maze mod called The Lambyrinth, a bunch of mutator mods, and some other stuff, but nothing much else. I would love if there could be the following mods: PvP Goat, First Person Shooter Goat, Zombies Goat, Michael Myers Goat, Hunger Games Goat, Maze Runner Goat, Spleef Goat, etc (really just any minigame from Minecraft or Call of Duty).IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING it would be the trampolines. They are really frustrating. All I wanna do is go up and down, but the physics make you go side to side according to the direction you fall on the way down.OVERALL, I recommend this game. Especially if you have a hilarious sense of humour (mine has altogether disappeared over the years) and a couple of friends who will watch over your shoulder and maybe do some of the co-op minigames that are scattered throughout the game with you - I like the one where I get to ride on a bike... very fun.\n",
      "NEW NEW REVIEW (hackers come back again):This game has been hacked to include dedicated servers (at least for Australians). However, I would say that the game is pretty much on its last leg cause even the hackers are messing up the hacked dedicated servers. I would not buy this game except for the singleplayer, so therefore I am officially saying goodbye to this game and recommend that you do too.NEW REVIEW (after hackers):For some reason, I think since the last update they got rid of hackers - the game is much more fun now, although multiplayer is still dead. But I guess that it doesn't matter if you have a high internet speed like I do. Would be even more fun if I had some friends, but I don't...P.S. I miss the Favela map :(OLD REVIEW (before hackers):If you just want this game for the Single-Player and Co-Op (if you have a friend around), and especially to get all the Steam Achievements, then I completely recommend this game - very fun, and excellent hand-eye co-ordination training. I honestly just play this game on Veteran to test and improve my skills.On the other hand, even though this is my absolute most favourite game, I give this game a negative review because the most important aspect of the game (Multiplayer) is DEAD. Yes, it is still possible to play (although you will need a good internet speed to be able to connect with about 1000 people from around the world), but a minority of hackers have completely devastated the matchmaking system because IW do not moderate it anymore.I don't care if I get put into altered-physics games with noob toob explosions everywhere (they're actually pretty fun), but when hackers screw up my ranks and give me level 10 prestige with all achievements and accolades completed without my consent, I really can't take it. That's why I now have to give this game a negative review, even though it used to be so fun.There are work-arounds to the rank-changing problem though (but probably not worth it). I would recommend:- Unsyncing your MW2 files from the Steam Cloud and making constant back-ups of all your online files (if you intend to play on public lobbies) - there are tutorials, just search for a user called Laptop65- Finding a Steam group that host lots of private gamesI guess that's all I have to say...And if you want to play MW2 or any other CoD game with me, just add me cause I will accept.\n",

      "Aren't you glad Team Fortress 2 didn't wind up looking like this? Valve has created quite a game with the long-awaited Team Fortress sequel, bearing many similarities to its predecessor, though incorporating enough changes to make it feel fresh. The most obvious aspect, which you may have noticed from any of the screens and video posted, is the visual style. Even after getting sucked into probably too many hours of play in the beta over the past few weeks, we're still amazed at the art design, both in how it looks and how it animates. But let's not get too carried away with the graphics. It's a game, after all, and the most important factor is how it plays and if it's entertaining. It's interesting to see both Team Fortress 2, which has been in development on and off for some seven years now, and Splash Damage's Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which has seen its own share of setbacks and delays, finally come out right around the same time. Their nearly simultaneous retail release presents and interesting situation for you, the consumer, as to how to spend your cash. You may fondly remember your days in Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, dropping air strikes on hapless attackers and eagerly charging into bunkers to spout forth deadly plumes of flamethrower fuel. Yet you can't forget your days with Team Fortress Classic, or even further back with the original Team Fortress Quake mod, with its now painfully dated character models but compelling team-focused online play.  There's really no right answer in this case as to which game is ultimately better. It's merely personal preference. Quake Wars is assuredly the more complicated game. For those uninitiated in the ways of Enemy Territory, the scope, dynamic objectives, speed at which the tide of battle can turn and the number of things you need to quickly consider when that happens, and user interface can be rather daunting. After learning the ins and outs it's clearly an excellent product, but it lacks that immediate, irresistible appeal so prominent in Valve's Team Fortress 2. And accessibility may very well be the deciding factor in determining which product users prefer. Regardless, it's an excellent time to be a gamer, since as tough as it may be to pick one or the other, making either choice rewards you with a well designed and highly entertaining title. Like in Team Fortress Classic (TFC), Team Fortress 2 has nine character classes: Spy, Pyro, Soldier, Heavy, Medic, Sniper, Demoman, Scout and Engineer. Each class' abilities on the battlefield have been streamlined, which, along with the graphics, is what makes Team Fortress 2 so much more accessible than TFC. No longer do you have Engineers running around with railguns and EMP grenades. Medics can't \"infect\" the other team, Spies don't have tranquilizer darts, and none of the classes have hand grenades. In TF2, each class has roughly three main ways of attacking - a primary weapon (the Heavy's minigun, Pyro's flamethrower, Engineer's sentry gun, etc.) and secondary (various classes have shotguns, others pistols, while the Demoman has a highly effective mine thrower) and melee weapons (the Scout's bat, the Medic's bonesaw, and so on). Though classes now possess fewer means of attacking, the resulting gameplay feels much more focused. Each class has a very clearly defined role and the means to ensure they perform successfully. The only limiting factor is, of course, how effectively your team meshes together.  If your Engineers aren't guarding their structures, Spies can wipe them out in seconds with a few sapper charges. If your team is full of Heavies and Soldiers but lacks Medics, you're not going to get very far. If you're playing a capture point map without any Scouts on your team, you might as well just leave the server or start berating your squadmates until a few switch classes. The Medic, though, seems to be the hinge on which all gameplay balance swivels. For TF2 they've been given a health hose, which blasts out a restorative stream at friendlies within range and \"sticks\" to them as long as you keep the fire button depressed. As you heal injured teammates, or \"overheal\" to 150 percent health, an ubercharge meter builds in the bottom right of the screen. Unleashing this renders both target and Medic invulnerable for a few seconds, which is sometimes the only way to break through chokepoints populated with Heavies, Medics, and multiple tier three sentry guns. Even though Medics may be the most vital to a team's success, the other classes remain useful. Scouts, who are now rather deadly, are far and away the fastest, and their ability to double-jump and change direction in mid-air makes then all the more difficult to hit. Spies, in addition to being able to one-hit kill backstab the enemy, cause general chaos among enemy ranks. If your opponents know a spy is running around, they'll waste time and lose focus by shooting at their own teammates to try and reveal a disguised culprit. Pyros tend to be the most effective spy detectors, and can be frequently seen doing fiery pirouettes in 2Fort matches all over the beta servers, as a spy incognito will betray his cover by bursting into flames upon contact with the burning spray.In a September 26 Steam update, friendly fire was removed from TF2, which was definitely a good move. Friendly fire ruins much of the game considering the close-quarters maps combined with the wide area of effect attacks of Heavies, Pyros, Demomen, and Soldiers. Without FF, teammates are free to shoot each other, since if they bleed health, they're a spy.\n",
      "The tensest moment in Five Nights at Freddy s 4 is a one-second lean. I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.Nothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.FNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.Boy meets demonAbove anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquainted—a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanic—but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.Replacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.As before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cues—muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside You—indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.And that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.A minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night.But it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfect—as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant death—greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.In many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over—door, listen, flashlight, repeat—is too much of a chore to fully pull me in. It s certainly the scariest of the four, but the subtle uneasiness and self-doubt so tellingly accomplished in its older brothers is diminished.\n",

      "An old man awaits at the entrance of a dungeon. Stricken by a mysterious curse, he urges you to return after the sun has set, to free him of the madness that has infected his body. So you spend the day amid the grassy splendor of Terraria, surveying caves, slaying rabbits and slimes, as the hours tick by. Once night has set, you return to the old man, to free him of his curse and reap whatever rewards he wishes to give you. It turns out that the little curse transformed the old man into a demonic skeleton, a hovering monstrosity that unleashes holy hell upon your poorly equipped explorer. The battle rages for 10 seconds, maybe 20 if you run away at the onset, and then you're left staring at your corpse and wondering how you could ever defeat such a beast.But there's no reason to be deterred by such a thorough beating. Terraria uses an empowering sense of discovery to grab you, and that unrestrained freedom is a double-edged sword. Free to explore the untouched lands, you may happen upon a monster much more powerful than you, or you may find a chest filled with precious treasures. You're never sure where your travels will lead you, but your curiosity is always rewarded. You may gain knowledge, such as knowing not to talk to old men at night, or happen upon a cache of gold, which can be used to forge a powerful sword. It's a world bursting with possibilities. Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.An apartment complex reaching toward the sky gives your helpers plenty of room for themselves.Terraria debuted on the PC almost two years ago, and I was worried how such a mouse-heavy game could make the transition to a traditional control scheme. After a little practice, my worries were thankfully banished. Movement works remarkably well on the Vita, which makes sense given that Terraria feels like a 2D platformer. Performing precise jumps and grappling up walls feel even better using an analog stick instead of keyboard keys, so there's joy in traversing the world that didn't exist before. However, movement isn't nearly as important as excavation, and that's where patience matters. No longer can you dig precisely with a mouse; instead, you use a stick. The game has two options, manual and smart, which have different strengths and weaknesses. If you're clearing a deep hole, smart is blunt and effective. If you need to focus on individual blocks, manual works fine. Unfortunately, your cursor is controlled by both the right stick and the back touchpad, and there's no way to disable the second scheme, so you do have to hold the Vita carefully lest you dig haphazardly.Terraria is an incredible adventure that continually excites your imagination with the endless secrets that await.Discovery is the essence of Terraria, but thankfully that doesn't extend to basic play concepts. The PC version struggled to communicate exactly what you were supposed to do in this expansive world, and though the Vita version doesn't spell out every detail, it does a great job of pushing you in the right direction. Shelter is the most pressing matter for a lone explorer. Chop down trees to gain wood, and then use that wood to build a house. Once you lay out the frame, you need doors and a chair to complete the requirements, and that's where you get your first hint at what makes Terraria so appealing. You're told to make a crafting table, and by standing near it, you can make the rest of the pieces to finish your house. And there are a lot more items you can craft beyond that. With a bevy of weapons and armor, clothes and decorations, there are tons of tools you can make that help you become a better explorer.A little snow never hurt anyone.The items you can craft are clearly spelled out for you, so you're never unclear about what's possible. Once you acquire any of the plentiful materials strewn about the land, you learn how you can use them to craft something that could help you on the journey. Turn cobwebs into silk and then combine that with wood to make a bed. Melt silver nuggets into bars and then pound those into a shining suit at your anvil. By seeing exactly what items you can create, you're pushed to gather those materials as quickly as you can. You want that jungle hat, right? Well, you better find an underground jungle and gather spores if you want to sport that fine protective gear. An enticing cycle of hunting for materials followed by reaping a reward crops up in the early moments. Once you have golden armor and tools, you can venture further, which allows you to access even more powerful weapons.Much of your time in Terraria is spent digging elaborate tunnels beneath the surface. It's there that the most precious resources are buried, so you grab some torches and try to fend off the skeletons and bats as you dig ever deeper down. It's a slow process that stays compelling for two important reasons. First, with so many secrets hidden below, you continually stumble upon exciting new areas. Maybe you land at a place filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that can be brewed into a handy potion, or find a makeshift house hiding a treasure chest. You never know, so you keep digging. Second, there's a puzzle element to digging successfully. When you chip away at rock in the deep end of a lake, you have to figure out how to manage your dwindling supply of oxygen while going further down. Or you may have to divert water toward smoldering lava to create obsidian. You're always planning the best possible route, while fending off enemies, which keeps you engaged during those solitary hours carving out earth.It would be so much easier to mine this meteor if aliens weren't flying at your head.Once you harvest enough gold to drape yourself in it, you may wonder where you're supposed to go next. Well, thankfully, there's a guide who can point you in the right direction. Building houses attracts non-player characters, and each has his or her own way to help you. The guide tells you that it's finally time to fight a boss, and even details how to summon it, which is a godsend if you're lost. If you have an explosive in your inventory, a blast-happy dude moves in who happily sells you dynamite and bombs. There's no way to know exactly what will lure more NPCs to your commune, so just experiment with everything possible. None of them are necessary to complete your adventure, but they are a handy resource when you're stumped. Just make sure you fortify your walls. You wouldn't want a goblin army killing your only friends.Combat in Terraria is often simple. Killing slimes is more about positioning than deeper tactics, so most enemies serve as a distraction rather than a serious roadblock. Of course, you could play with permadeath if you want a real challenge, or lose all of your items upon every death, but such consequences were so severe for me that I didn't want to venture forth, which defeats the point of the game. The normal option is that you lose money when you die, which is a gentle scolding more than a serious setback.Digging a helevator is the quickest way to reach the bottom of the world.Be prepared to die a lot when bosses make an appearance. Every battle is against a massive beast that dwarfs your feeble adventurer, so you have to be smart and well prepared if you're going to come out on top. If you collect enough shooting stars beforehand, you can craft mana crystals that let you use magic. It's much safer to shoot magical strikes from a distance than to get up close with your warhammer. Still, there are many different tactics to take out the various bosses. And, who knows, maybe you won't have a chance to plan out a strategy at all. The Eye of Cthulhu randomly appears once you've become powerful enough, and it's crazy to fight this flying beast while in a subterranean jungle. Always be prepared for a fight; you wouldn't want to lose your hard-earned money because you forgot your bow\n",
